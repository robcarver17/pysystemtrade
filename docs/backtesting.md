This guide is divided into four parts. The first ['How do I?'](#how_do_i)
explains how to do many common tasks. The second part ['Guide'](#guide) details
the relevant parts of the code, and explains how to modify or create new parts.
The third part ['Processes'](#Processes) discusses certain processes that cut
across multiple parts of the code in more detail. The final part
['Reference'](#reference) includes lists of methods and parameters.

## How do I.... Experiment with a single trading rule and instrument

Although the project is intended mainly for working with trading systems, it's
possible to do some limited experimentation without building a system. See [the
introduction](introduction.md) for an example.

## How do I....Create a standard futures backtest

This creates the staunch systems trader example defined in chapter 15 of my
book, using the csv data that is provided, and gives you the position in the
Eurodollar market:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")
```
See [standard futures system](#futures_system) for more.


## How do I....Create a futures backtest which estimates parameters

This creates the staunch systems trader example defined in chapter 15 of my
book, using the csv data that is provided, and estimates forecast scalars,
instrument and forecast weights, and instrument and forecast diversification
multipliers:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.estimatedsystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")
```

See [estimated futures system](#futures_system).



## How do I....See intermediate results from a backtest

This will give you the raw forecast (before scaling and capping) of one of the
EWMAC rules for Eurodollar futures in the standard futures backtest:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.rules.get_raw_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac64_256")
```

For a complete list of possible intermediate results, use `print(system)` to
see the names of each stage, and then `stage_name.methods()`. Or see [this
table](#table_system_stage_methods) and look for rows marked with **D** for
diagnostic. Alternatively type `system` to get a list of stages, and
`system.stagename.methods()` to get a list of methods for a stage (insert the
name of the stage, not stagename).


## How do I....See how profitable a backtest was

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.accounts.portfolio().stats() ## see some statistics
system.accounts.portfolio().curve().plot() ## plot an account curve
system.accounts.portfolio().percent.curve().plot() ## plot an account curve in percentage terms
system.accounts.pandl_for_instrument("US10").percent.stats() ## produce % statistics for a 10 year bond
system.accounts.pandl_for_instrument_forecast("EDOLLAR", "carry").sharpe() ## Sharpe for a specific trading rule variation
```

For more information on what statistics are available, see the [relevant guide
section](#standard_accounts_stage).



<a name="change_backtest_parameters"> </a>

## How do I....Change backtest parameters

The backtest looks for its configuration information in the following places:

1. Elements in the configuration object
2. If not found, in: the private yaml config if it exists here `/private/private_config.yaml`
3. If not found, in: Project defaults

Configuration objects can be loaded from [yaml](https://pyyaml.org/) files, or
created with a dictionary. This suggests that you can modify the systems
behaviour in any of the following ways:

1. Change or create a configuration yaml file, read it in, and create a new
   system
2. Change a configuration object in memory, and create a new system with it.
3. Change a configuration object within an existing system (advanced)
4. Create a private config yaml `/private/private_config.yaml` (this useful if you want to make a global change that affects all your backtest)
5. Change the project defaults (definitely not recommended)

For a list of all possible configuration options, see [this
table](#Configuration_options).

If you use options 2 or 3, you can [save the config](#save_config) to a yaml
file.

### Option 1: Change the configuration file

Configurations in this project are stored in [yaml](https://pyyaml.org) files.
Don't worry if you're not familiar with yaml; it's just a nice way of creating
nested dicts, lists and other python objects in plain text. Just be aware that
indentations are important, just in like python, to create nesting.

You can make a new config file by copying this
[one](/systems/provided/futures_chapter15/futuresconfig.yaml), and modifying
it. Best practice is to save this as
`pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/config.yaml` (you'll need to create a
couple of directories first).

You should then create a new system which points to the new config file:

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

my_config=Config("private.this_system_name.config.yaml")
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
```

See [here](#filenames) for how to specify filenames in pysystemtrade.

### Option 2: Change the configuration object; create a new system

We can also modify a configuration object from a loaded system directly, and
then create a new system with it:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config

new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM

new_config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

## Heres an example of how you'd change a nested parameter
## If the element doesn't yet exist in your config:

system.config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)

## If it does exist:
system.config.volatility_calculation['days']=20


system=futures_system(config=new_config)
```

This is useful if you're experimenting interactively 'on the fly'.


### Option 3: Change the configuration object within an existing system (not recommended - advanced)

If you opt for (3) you will need to understand about [system caching](#caching)
and [how defaults are handled](#defaults_how). To modify the configuration
object in the system directly:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()

## Anything we do with the system may well be cached and will need to be cleared before it sees the new value...


new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

## If we change anything that is nested, we need to change just one element to avoid clearing the defaults:
# So, do this:
system.config.volatility_calculation['days']=20

# Do NOT do this - it will wipe out all the other elements in the volatility_calculation dictionary:
# system.config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)


## The config is updated, but to reiterate anything that uses it will need to be cleared from the cache
```

Because we don't create a new system and have to recalculate everything from
scratch, this can be useful for testing isolated changes to the system **if**
you know what you're doing.

### Option 4: Create a `/private/private_config.yaml` file

This makes sense if you want to make a global change to a particular parameter rather than constantly including certain things in your configuration files. Anything in this file will overwrite the system defaults, but will in turn be overwritten by the backtest configuration .yaml file. This file will also come in very handy when it comes to [using pysystemtrade as a production trading environment](/production.md)


### Option 5: Change the project defaults (definitely not recommended)

I don't recommend changing the defaults - a lot of tests will fail for a
start - but should you want to more information is given [here](#defaults).


## How do I....Run a backtest on a different set of instruments

Fixed instrument weights: You need to change the instrument weights in the
configuration. Only instruments with weights have positions produced for them.
Estimated instrument weights: You need to change the instruments section of the
configuration.

There are two easy ways to do this - change the config file, or the config
object already in the system (for more on changing config parameters see
['change backtest parameters'](#change_backtest_parameters) ). You also need to
ensure that you have the data you need for any new instruments. See ['use my
own data'](#create_my_own_data) below.


### Change instruments: Change the configuration file

You should make a new config file by copying this
[one](/systems/provided/futures_chapter15/futuresconfig.yaml). Best practice is
to save this as `pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/config.yaml` (you'll
need to create this directory).

For fixed weights, you can then change this section of the config:

```
instrument_weights:
    EDOLLAR: 0.117
    US10: 0.117
    EUROSTX: 0.20
    V2X: 0.098
    MXP: 0.233
    CORN: 0.233
instrument_div_multiplier: 1.89
```

You may also have to change the forecast_weights, if they're instrument
specific:

```
forecast_weights:
   EDOLLAR:
     ewmac16_64: 0.21
     ewmac32_128: 0.08
     ewmac64_256: 0.21
     carry: 0.50
```


*At this stage you'd also need to recalculate the diversification multiplier
(see chapter 11 of my book). See [estimating the forecast diversification
multiplier](#divmult).

For estimated instrument weights you'd change this section:

```
instruments: ["EDOLLAR", "US10", "EUROSTX", "V2X", "MXP", "CORN"]
```

Note that if moving from fixed to estimated instrument weights (by changing `system.config.use_instrument_weight_estimates` to `True`), the set of instruments selected in your `system.config.instrument_weights` will be ignored; if you want to continue using this same set of instruments, you need to say so:

```python
system.config.instruments = list(system.config.instrument_weights.keys())
```

(The IDM will be re-estimated automatically)

You may also need to change this section, if you have different rules for each
instrument:

```
rule_variations:
     EDOLLAR: ['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'carry']
```

You should then create a new system which points to the new config file:

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config

my_config=Config("private.this_system_name.config.yaml")

from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
```

See [here](#filenames) for how to specify filenames in pysystemtrade.



### Change instruments: Change the configuration object

We can also modify the configuration object in the system directly:

For fixed weights:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config

new_weights=dict(SP500=0.5, KR10=0.5) ## create new weights
new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM

new_config.instrument_weights=new_weights
new_config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

system=futures_system(config=new_config)

```

For estimated weights:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.estimatedsystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config

new_config.instruments=["SP500", "KR10"]

del(new_config.rule_variations) ## means all instruments will use all trading rules

# this stage is optional if we want to give different instruments different sets of rules
new_config.rule_variations=dict(SP500=['ewmac16_64','carry'], KR10=['ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'carry'])

system=futures_system(config=new_config)

```

## How do I.... run the backtest only on more recent data

You need to set the start_date in the .yaml backtest configuration file:

```
## Note you must use this format
start_date: '2000-01-19'
```




## How do I....Run a backtest on all available instruments

If there are is no `instrument_weights` or `instruments` elements in the config, then the backtest will be run over all available instruments in the data. 

## How do I.... Exclude some instruments from the backtest

Refer to the [instruments document](/instruments.md).

## How do I.... Exclude some instruments from having positive instrument weights

Refer to the [instruments document](/instruments.md).



<a name="how_do_i_write_rules"> </a>

## How do I....Create my own trading rule

At some point you should read the relevant guide section
['rules'](#TradingRules) as there is much more to this subject than I will
explain briefly here.


### Writing the function


A trading rule consists of:

- a function
- some data (specified as positional arguments)
- some optional control arguments (specified as key word arguments)


So the function must be something like these:

```python
def trading_rule_function(data1):
   ## do something with data1

def trading_rule_function(data1, arg1=default_value):
   ## do something with data1
   ## controlled by value of arg1

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2):
   ## do something with data1 and data2

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2, arg1=default_value, arg2=default_value):
   ## do something with data1
   ## controlled by value of arg1 and arg2

```
... and so on.

Functions must return a Tx1 pandas dataframe.

### Adding the trading rule to a configuration

We can either modify the YAML file or the configuration object we've already
loaded into memory. See ['changing backtest
parameters'](#change_backtest_parameters) for more details. If you want to use a
YAML file you need to first save the function into a .py module, so it can be
referenced by a string (we can also use this method for a config object in
memory).

For example the rule imported like this:

```python
from systems.futures.rules import ewmac
```

Can also be referenced like so: `systems.futures.rules.ewmac`

Also note that the list of data for the rule will also be in the form of string
references to methods in the system object. So for example to get the daily
price we'd use the method `system.rawdata.daily_prices(instrument_code)` (for a
list of all the data methods in a system see [stage
methods](#table_system_stage_methods) or type `system.rawdata.methods()` and
`system.rawdata.methods()`). In the trading rule specification this would be
shown as "rawdata.daily_prices".

If no data is included, then the system will default to passing a single data
item - the price of the instrument. Finally if any or all the `other_arg`
keyword arguments are missing then the function will use its own defaults.

At this stage we can also remove any trading rules that we don't want. We also
ought to modify the forecast scalars (See [forecast scale
estimation](#scalar_estimate]), forecast weights and probably the forecast
diversification multiplier (see [estimating the forecast diversification
multiplier](#divmult)). If you're estimating weights and scalars (i.e. in the
pre-baked estimated futures system provided) this will be automatic.

*If you're using fixed values (the default) then if you don't include a
forecast scalar for the rule, it will use a value of 1.0. If you don't include
forecast weights in your config then the system will default to equally
weighting. But if you include forecast weights, but miss out the new rule, then
it won't be used to calculate the combined forecast.*

Here's an example for a new variation of the EWMAC rule. This rule uses two
types of data - the price (stitched for futures), and a precalculated estimate
of volatility.

YAML: (example)
```
trading_rules:
  .... existing rules ...
  new_rule:
     function: systems.futures.rules.ewmac
     data:
         - "rawdata.daily_prices"
         - "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"
     other_args:
         Lfast: 10
         Lslow: 40
#
#
## Following section is for fixed scalars, weights and div. multiplier:
#
forecast_scalars:
  ..... existing rules ....
  new_rule=10.6
#
forecast_weights:
  .... existing rules ...
  new_rule=0.10
#
forecast_div_multiplier=1.5
#
#
## Alternatively if you're estimating these quantities use this section:
#
use_forecast_weight_estimates: True
use_forecast_scale_estimates: True
use_forecast_div_mult_estimates: True

rule_variations:
     EDOLLAR: ['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule']
#
# OR if all variations are the same for all instruments
#
rule_variations: ['ewmac16_64','ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule']
#
```



Python (example - assuming we already have a config object loaded to modify)

```python

from systems.trading_rules import TradingRule

# method 1
new_rule = TradingRule(
   dict(function="systems.futures.rules.ewmac", data=["rawdata.daily_prices", "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"],
        other_args=dict(Lfast=10, Lslow=40)))

# method 2 - good for functions created on the fly
from systems.futures.rules import ewmac

new_rule = TradingRule(dict(function=ewmac, data=["rawdata.daily_prices", "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"],
                            other_args=dict(Lfast=10, Lslow=40)))

## both methods - modify the configuration
config.trading_rules['new_rule'] = new_rule

## If you're using fixed weights and scalars

config.forecast_scalars['new_rule'] = 7.0
config.forecast_weights = dict(...., new_rule=0.10)  ## all existing forecast weights will need to be updated
config.forecast_div_multiplier = 1.5

## If you're using estimates

config.use_forecast_scale_estimates = True
config.use_forecast_weight_estimates = True
use_forecast_div_mult_estimates: True

config.rule_variations = ['ewmac16_64', 'ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule']
# or to specify different variations for different instruments
config.rule_variations = dict(SP500=['ewmac16_64', 'ewmac32_128', 'ewmac64_256', 'new_rule'], US10=['new_rule', ....)
```

Once we've got the new config, by which ever method, we just use it in our
system, eg:

```python
## put into a new system

from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(config=config)
```


<a name="create_my_own_data"> </a>

## How do I....Use different data or instruments

The default data used for the simulation is .csv files for futures stitched
prices, fx and contract related data. It's my intention to update
this and try to keep it reasonably current with each release. The data is stored in the [data/futures directory](/data/futures/)

You can update that data, if you wish. Be careful to save it as a .csv with the
right formatting, or pandas will complain. Check that a file is correctly
formatted like so:

```python
import pandas as pd
test=pd.read_csv("filename.csv")
test
```
You can also add new files for new instruments. Be sure to keep the file format and header names consistent.

You can create your own directory for .csv files. For example supposed you wanted to get your adjusted prices from
`pysystemtrade/private/system_name/adjusted_price_data`. Here is how you'd use it:

```python
from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

data=csvFuturesSimData(csv_data_paths=dict(csvFuturesAdjustedPricesData = "private.system_name.adjusted_price_data"))
system=futures_system(data=data)
```
Notice that we use python style "." internal references within a project, we don't give actual path names. See [here](#filenames) for how to specify filenames in pysystemtrade.

The full list of keys that you can use in the `csv_data_paths` are:
* `csvFuturesInstrumentData` (configuration and costs)
* `csvFuturesMultiplePricesData` (prices for current, next and carry contracts)
* `csvFuturesAdjustedPricesData` (stitched back-adjusted prices)
* `csvFxPricesData` (for FX prices)
* `csvRollParametersData` (for roll configuration)
  
Note that you can't put adjusted prices and carry data in the same directory since they use the same file format.

There is more detail about using .csv files [here](#csv).

If you want to store your data in Mongo DB databases instead you need to [use a different data object](#arctic_data).

If you want to get your data from Quandl.com, then see the document [working with futures data](/data.md)

If you want to get data from a different place (eg a database, yahoo finance,
broker, quandl...) you'll need to [create your own Data object](#create_data).

If you want to use a different set of data values (eg equity EP ratios,
interest rates...) you'll need to [create your own Data object](#create_data).

If you want to delve deeper into data storage see the document [working with futures data](/data.md)

## How do I... Save my work

To remain organised it's good practice to save any work into a directory like
`pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/` (you'll need to create the
directory first). If you plan to contribute to github, just be careful to
avoid adding 'private' to your commit ( [you may want to read
this](https://24ways.org/2013/keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-private-on-github/)
).

You can save the contents of a system cache to avoid having to redo
calculations when you come to work on the system again (but you might want to
read about [system caching and pickling](#caching) before you reload them).

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

system = futures_system()
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## does a whole bunch of calculations that will be saved in the cache

system.cache.pickle("private.this_system_name.system.pck") ## use any file extension you like

## In a new session
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

system = futures_system()
system.cache.unpickle("private.this_system_name.system.pck")

## this will run much faster and reuse previous calculations
# only complex accounting p&l objects aren't saved in the cache
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe()

```

You can also save a config object into a yaml file - see [saving
configuration](#save_config).


<a name="guide"> </a>

# Guide


The guide section explains in more detail how each part of the system works:

1. [Data](#data) objects
2. [Config](#config) objects and yaml files
3. [System](#system) objects,
4. [Stages](#stage_general) within a system.

Each section is split into parts that get progressively trickier; varying from
using the standard objects that are supplied up to writing your own.

<a name="data"> </a>

## Data

A data object is used to feed data into a system. Data objects work with a
particular **kind** of data (normally asset class specific, eg futures) from a
particular **source** (for example .csv files, databases and so on).

### Using the standard data objects

Two kinds of specific data object is currently provided with the system in the
current version - `csvFuturesSimData` (.csv files) and `dbFuturesSimData` (database storage)

See [working with futures data](/data.md)


#### Generic data objects

You can import and use data objects directly:

*These commands will work with all data objects - the `csvFuturesSimData` version is
used as an example.*

```python
from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData

data=csvFuturesSimData()

## getting data out
data.methods() ## list of methods

data.get_raw_price(instrument_code)
data[instrument_code] ## does the same thing as get_raw_price

data.get_instrument_list()
data.keys() ## also gets the instrument list

data.get_value_of_block_price_move(instrument_code)
data.get_instrument_currency(instrument_code)
data.get_fx_for_instrument(instrument_code, base_currency) # get fx rate between instrument currency and base currency

```

Or within a system:

```python
## using with a system
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(data=data)

system.data.get_instrument_currency(instrument_code) # and so on
```

(Note that when specifying a data item within a trading [rule](#rules) you
should omit the system eg `data.get_raw_price`)

If you set the start_date configuration option, then only a subset of the data will be shown:


```python
## using with a system
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(data=data)

# We could also do this in the .yaml file. Note the formatting used must be the same
system.config.start_date = '2000-01-19'

## or as a datetime (won't work in yaml obviously)
import datetime
system.config.start_date = datetime.datetime(2000,1,19)
```



<a name="csvdata"> </a>

#### The csvFuturesSimData object

The `csvFuturesSimData` object works like this:

```python
from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData

## with the default folders
data=csvFuturesSimData()

## OR with different folders, by providing a dict containing the folder(s) to use
data=csvFuturesSimData(csv_data_paths = dict(key_name = "pathtodata.with.dots"))

# Permissible key names are 'csvFxPricesData' (FX prices), 'csvFuturesMultiplePricesData' 
# (for carry and forward prices),
# 'csvFuturesAdjustedPricesData' and 'csvFuturesInstrumentData' (configuration and costs).
# If a keyname is not present then the system defaults will be used

# An example to override with FX data stored in /psystemtrade/private/data/fxdata/:

data=csvFuturesSimData(csv_data_paths = dict(csvFxPricesData="private.data.fxdata"))

# WARNING: Do not store multiple_price_data and adjusted_price_data in the same directory
#          They use the same file names!

## getting data out
data.methods() ## will list any extra methods
data.get_instrument_raw_carry_data(instrument_code) ## specific data for futures

## using with a system
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(data=data)
system.data.get_instrument_raw_carry_data(instrument_code)
```

Each relevant pathname must contain .csv files of the following four types (where code is
the instrument_code):

1. Static configuration and cost data- `instrument_config.csv` headings: Instrument, Pointsize,
   AssetClass, Currency. Additional headings for costs: Slippage, PerBlock,
   Percentage, PerTrade. See ['costs'](#costs) for more detail.
2. Roll parameters data. See [storing futures and spot FX data](/data.md) for more detail.
3. Adjusted price data- `code.csv` (eg SP500.csv) headings: DATETIME, PRICE
4. Carry and forward data - `code.csv` (eg AEX.csv): headings:
   DATETIME, PRICE,CARRY,FORWARD,CARRY_CONTRACT PRICE_CONTRACT, FORWARD_CONTRACT
5. Currency data - `ccy1ccy2fx.csv` (eg AUDUSDfx.csv) headings: DATETIME,
   FXRATE

DATETIME should be something that `pandas.to_datetime` can parse. Note that the
price in (2) is the continuously stitched price (see [volatility
calculation](#vol_calc) ), whereas the price column in (3) is the price of the
contract we're currently trading.

At a minimum we need to have a currency file for each instrument's currency
against the default (defined as "USD"); and for the currency of the account
we're trading in (i.e. for a UK investor you'd need a `GBPUSDfx.csv` file). If
cross rate files are available they will be used; otherwise the USD rates will
be used to work out implied cross rates.

See data in subdirectories [pysystemtrade/data/futures](/data/futures) for files you can modify:

- [adjusted prices](/data/futures/adjusted_prices_csv),
- [configuration and costs](/data/futures/csvconfig),
- [Futures specific carry and forward prices](/data/futures/multiple_prices_csv)
- [Spot FX prices](/data/futures/fx_prices_csv)

For more information see the [futures data document](/data.md#csvFuturesSimData).

<a name="arctic_data"> </a>

#### The arcticSimData object

This is a simData object which gets it's data out of [Mongo DB](https://mongodb.com) (static) and [Arctic](https://github.com/manahl/arctic) (time series) (*Yes the class name should include both terms. Yes I shortened it so it isn't ridiculously long, and most of the interesting stuff comes from Arctic*). It is better for live trading.

For production code, and storing large amounts of data (eg for individual futures contracts) we probably need something more robust than .csv files.
[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) is a no-sql database which is rather fashionable at the moment, though the main reason I selected it for this purpose is that it is used by Arctic. [Arctic](https://github.com/manahl/arctic) is a superb open source time series database which sits on top of Mongo DB) and provides straightforward and fast storage of pandas DataFrames. It was created by my former colleagues at [Man AHL](https://www.ahl.com/) (in fact I beta tested a very early version of Arctic), and then very generously released as open source.

There is more detail on this in the [futures data documentation](/data.md): [Mongo DB](/data.md#mongoDB) and [Arctic](/data.md#arctic).

##### Setting up your Arctic and Mongo DB databases

Obviously you will need to make sure you already have a Mongo DB instance running. You might find you already have one running, in Linux use `ps wuax | grep mongo` and then kill the relevant process. You also need to get [Arctic](https://github.com/manahl/arctic).

Because the mongoDB data isn't included in the github repo, before using this you need to write the required data into Mongo and Arctic.
You can do this from scratch, as per the ['futures data workflow'](/data.md#a-futures-data-workflow). Alternatively you can run the following scripts which will copy the data from the existing github .csv files:

- [Instrument configuration and cost data](/sysinit/futures/repocsv_instrument_config.py)
- [Adjusted prices](/sysinit/futures/repocsv_adjusted_prices.py)
- [Multiple prices](/sysinit/futures/repocsv_multiple_prices.py)
- [Spot FX prices](/sysinit/futures/repocsv_spotfx_prices.py)

Of course it's also possible to mix these two methods.

##### Using dbFuturesSimData

Once you have the data it's just a matter of replacing the default csv data object:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
from sysdata.sim.db_futures_sim_data import dbFuturesSimData

# with the default database
data = dbFuturesSimData()

# using with a system
system = futures_system()
print(system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe())
```



### Creating your own data objects

You should be familiar with the python object orientated idiom before reading
this section.

The [`simData()`](/sysdata/sim/sim_data.py) object is the base class for data used in simulations. From that we
inherit data type specific classes such as those
[for futures](/sysdata/sim/futures_sim_data.py) object. These in turn are inherited from
for specific data sources, such as for csv files: [csvFuturesSimData()](/sysdata/sim/csv_futures_sim_data.py).

It is helpful if this naming scheme was adhered to: sourceTypeSimData. For example if we had
some single equity data stored in a database we'd do `class
EquitiesSimData(simData)`, and `class dbEquitiesSimData(EquitiesSimData)`.

So, you should consider whether you need a new type of data, a new source of
data or both. You may also wish to extend an existing class. For example if you
wished to add some fundamental data for futures you might define: `class
fundamentalFuturesSimData(futuresSimData)`. You'd then need to inherit from that for a
specific source.

This might seem a hassle, and it's tempting to skip and just inherit from
`simData()` directly, however once your system is up and running it is very
convenient to have the possibility of multiple data sources and this process
ensures they keep a consistent API for a given data type.

It's worth reading the [documentation on futures data](/data.md#modify_SimData) to understand how [csvFuturesSimData()](/sysdata/sim/csv_futures_sim_data.py) is constructed before modifying it or creating your own data objects.

#### The Data() class

Methods that you'll probably want to override:

- `get_raw_price` Returns Tx1 pandas data frame
- `get_instrument_list` Returns list of str
- `get_value_of_block_price_move` Returns float
- `get_raw_cost_data` Returns a dict cost data
- `get_instrument_currency`: Returns str
- `_get_fx_data(currency1, currency2)` Returns Tx1 pandas data frame of
  exchange rates
- 'get_rolls_per_year': returns int

You should not override `get_fx_for_instrument`, or any of the other private fx
related methods. Once you've created a `_get_fx_data method`, then the methods
in the `Data` base class will interact to give the correct fx rate when
external objects call `get_fx_for_instrument()`; handling cross rates and
working them out as needed.

Neither should you override 'daily_prices'.

Finally data methods should not do any caching. [Caching](#caching) is done
within the system class.


<a name="config"> </a>

## Configuration

Configuration (`config`) objects determine how a system behaves. Configuration
objects are very simple; they have attributes which contain either parameters,
or nested groups of parameters.


### Creating a configuration object

There are three main ways to create a configuration object:

1. Interactively from a dictionary
2. By pulling in a YAML file
3. From a 'pre-baked' system
4. By joining together multiple configurations in a list

#### 1) Creating a configuration object with a dictionary

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config

my_config_dict=dict(optionone=1, optiontwo=dict(a=3.0, b="beta", c=["a", "b"]), optionthree=[1.0, 2.0])
my_config=Config(my_config_dict)
```

There are no restrictions on what is nested in the dictionary, but if you
include arbitrary items like the above they won't be very useful!. The section
on [configuration options](#Configuration_options) explains what configuration
options would be used by a system.

#### 2) Creating a configuration object from a file

This simple file will reproduce the useless config we get from a dictionary in
the example above.

```
optionone: 1
optiontwo:
  a: 3.0
  b: "beta"
  c:
    - "a"
    - "b"
optionthree:
  - 1.0
  - 2.0
```

Note that as with python the indentation in a yaml file shows how things are
nested. If you want to learn more about yaml check [this
out](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#YAMLsyntax).

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
my_config=Config("private.filename.yaml") ## assuming the file is in "pysystemtrade/private/filename.yaml"
```

See [here](#filenames) for how to specify filenames in pysystemtrade.


In theory there are no restrictions on what is nested in the dictionary (but
the top level must be a dict); although it is easier to use str, float, int,
lists and dicts, and the standard project code only requires those (if you're a
PyYAML expert you can do other python objects like tuples, but it won't be
pretty).

You should respect the structure of the default config with respect to nesting, as
otherwise [the defaults](#defaults_how) won't be properly filled in.

The section on [configuration options](#Configuration_options) explains what
configuration options are available.


#### 3) Creating a configuration object from a pre-baked system

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config
```

Under the hood this is effectively getting a configuration from a .yaml file -
[this one](/systems/provided/futures_chapter15/futuresconfig.yaml).

Configs created in this way will include all [the defaults
populated](#defaults_how).


#### 4) Creating a configuration object from a list

We can also pass a list into `Config()`, where each item of the list contains a
dict or filename. For example we could do this with the simple filename example
above:

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config

my_config_dict=dict(optionfour=1, optionfive=dict(one=1, two=2.0))
my_config=Config(["filename.yaml", my_config_dict])
```

Note that if there are overlapping keynames, then those in latter parts of the
list of configs will override earlier versions.

This can be useful if, for example, we wanted to change the instrument weights
'on the fly' but keep the rest of the configuration unchanged.

#### 5) Creating configuration files from .csv files

Sometimes it is more convenient to specify certain parameters in a .csv file, then push them into a .yaml file. If you want to use this method then you can use these two functions:

```python
from sysinit.configtools.csvweights_to_yaml import instr_weights_csv_to_yaml  # for instrument weights
from sysinit.configtools.csvweights_to_yaml import forecast_weights_by_instrument_csv_to_yaml  # forecast weights for each instrument
from sysinit.configtools.csvweights_to_yaml import forecast_mapping_csv_to_yaml # Forecast mapping for each instrument
```

These will create .yaml files which can then be pasted into your existing configuration files.


<a name="defaults"> </a>

### Project defaults and private configuration

Many (but not all) configuration parameters have defaults which are used by the
system if the parameters are not in the object. These can be found in the
[defaults.yaml file](/sysdata/config/defaults.yaml). The section on
[configuration options](#Configuration_options) explains what the defaults are,
and where they are used.

I recommend that you do not change these defaults. It's better to use the
settings you want in each system configuration file, or use a private configuration file if this is something you want to apply to all your backtests.

If this file exists, `/private/private_config.yaml`, it will be used as a private configuration file.

Basically, whenever a configuration object is added to a system, if there is a private config file then we add the elements from that. Then for any remaining missing elements we add the elements from the defaults.yaml.


<a name="config_function_defaults"> </a>

#### Handling defaults when you change certain functions

In certain places you can change the function used to do a particular
calculation, eg volatility estimation (This does *not* include trading rules -
the way we change the functions for these is quite different). This is
straightforward if you're going to use the same arguments as the original
argument. However if you change the arguments you'll need to change the project
defaults .yaml file. I recommend keeping the original parameters, and adding
new ones with different names, to avoid accidentally breaking the system.


<a name="defaults_how"> </a>

#### How the defaults and private configuration work


When added to a system the config class fills in parameters that are missing
from the original config object, but are present in (i) the private .yaml file and (ii) the default .yaml file. For
example if forecast_scalar is missing from the config, then the default value
of 1.0 will be used. This works in a similar way for top level config items
that are lists, str, int and float.

This will also happen if you miss anything from a dict within the config (eg if
`config.forecast_div_mult_estimate` is a dict, then any keys present in this
dict in the default .yaml, but not in the config will be added). Finally it
will work for nested dicts, eg if any keys are missing from
`config.instrument_weight_estimate['correlation_estimate']` then they'll be filled
in from the default file. If something is a dict, or a nested dict, in the
config but not in the default (or vice versa) then values won't be replaced and
bad things could happen. It's better to keep your config files, and the default
file, with matching structures (for the items you want to change at least!). Again this is a good argument for adding new
parameters, and retaining the original ones.

Note this means that the config before, and after, it goes into a system object
will probably be different; the latter will be populated with defaults.

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
my_config=Config()
print(my_config) ## empty config
```

```
 Config with elements:
```

Now within a system:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(config=my_config)

print(system.config) ## full of defaults.
print(my_config) ## same object
```

```
 Config with elements: average_absolute_forecast, base_currency, buffer_method, buffer_size, buffer_trade_to_edge, forecast_cap, forecast_correlation_estimate, forecast_div_mult_estimate, forecast_div_multiplier, forecast_scalar, forecast_scalar_estimate, forecast_weight_estimate, instrument_correlation_estimate, instrument_div_mult_estimate, instrument_div_multiplier, instrument_weight_estimate, notional_trading_capital, percentage_vol_target, use_SR_costs, use_forecast_scale_estimates, use_forecast_weight_estimates, use_instrument_weight_estimates, volatility_calculation
```

Note this isn't enough for a working trading system as trading rules aren't
populated by the defaults:


```python
system.accounts.portfolio()
```

```
# deleted full error trace
Exception: A system config needs to include trading_rules, unless rules are passed when object created
```


### Viewing configuration parameters

Regardless of whether we create the dictionary using a yaml file or
interactively, we'll end up with a dictionary. The keys in the top level
dictionary will become attributes of the config. We can then use dictionary
keys or list positions to access any nested data. For example using the simple
config above:

```python
my_config.optionone
my_config.optiontwo['a']
my_config.optionthree[0]
```


### Modifying configuration parameters

It's equally straightforward to modify a config. For example using the simple
config above:

```python
my_config.optionone=1.0
my_config.optiontwo['d']=5.0
my_config.optionthree.append(6.3)
```

You can also add new top level configuration items:

```python
my_config.optionfour=20.0
setattr(my_config, "optionfour", 20.0) ## if you prefer
```

Or remove them:

```python
del(my_config.optionone)
```

With real configs you need to be careful with nested parameters:


```python
config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.1 ## not nested, no problem

## Heres an example of how you'd change a nested parameter
## If the element doesn't yet exist in your config
## If the element did exist, then obviously doing this would overwrite all other parameters in the config - so don't do it!

config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)

## If it does exist you can do this instead:
config.volatility_calculation['days']=20
```

This is especially true if you're changing the config that has been included within a system, which
will already include all the defaults:

```python
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.1 ## not nested, no problem

## If we change anything that is nested, we need to change just one element to avoid clearing the defaults:
# So, do this:
system.config.volatility_calculation['days']=20

# Do NOT do this:
# system.config.volatility_calculation=dict(days=20)
```


### Using configuration in a system

Once we're happy with our configuration we can use it in a system:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
```
Note it's only when a config is included in a system that the private configuration and defaults are populated.


### Including your own configuration options

If you develop your own stages or modify existing ones you might want to
include new configuration options. Here's what your code should do:


```python

## Assuming your config item is called my_config_item; in the relevant method:

    parameter=system.config.my_config_item

    ## You can also use nested configuration items, eg dict keyed by instrument_code (or nested lists)
    parameter=system.config.my_config_dict[instrument_code]

    ## Lists also work.

    parameter=system.config.my_config_list[1]

    ## (Note: it's possible to do tuples, but the YAML is quite messy. So I don't encourage it.)


```

You would then need to add the following kind of thing to your config file:

```
my_config_item: "ni"
my_config_dict:
   US10: 45.0
   US5: 0.10
my_config_list:
   - "first item"
   - "second item"
```

Similarly if you wanted to use project defaults for your new parameters you'll
also need to include them in the [defaults.yaml
file](/sysdata/config/defaults.yaml). Make sure you understand [how the
defaults work](#defaults_how).


<a name="save_config"> </a>

### Saving configurations

You can also save a config object into a yaml file:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
import yaml
from syscore.fileutils import resolve_path_and_filename_for_package

system = futures_system()
my_config = system.config

## make some changes to my_config here

filename = resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("private.this_system_name.config.yaml")

with open(filename, 'w') as outfile:
   outfile.write(yaml.dump(my_config, default_flow_style=True))
```

This is useful if you've been playing with a backtest configuration, and want
to record the changes you've made. Note this will save trading rule functions
as functions; this may not work and it will also be ugly. So you should use
strings to define rule functions (see [rules](#rules) for more information)

You can also save the final optimised parameters into fixed weights for live trading:


```python
# Assuming system already contains a system which has estimated values
from systems.diagoutput import systemDiag

sysdiag = systemDiag(system)
sysdiag.yaml_config_with_estimated_parameters('someyamlfile.yaml',
                                              attr_names=['forecast_scalars',
                                                                  'forecast_weights',
                                                                  'forecast_div_multiplier',
                                                                  'forecast_mapping',
                                                                  'instrument_weights',
                                                                  'instrument_div_multiplier'])

```
Change the list of attr_names depending on what you want to output. You can then merge the resulting .yaml file into your simulated .yaml file. Don't forget to turn off the flags for `use_forecast_div_mult_estimates`,`use_forecast_scale_estimates`,`use_forecast_weight_estimates`,`use_instrument_div_mult_estimates`, and `use_instrument_weight_estimates`.  You don't need to change flag for forecast mapping, since this isn't done by default.


### Modifying the configuration class

It shouldn't be necessary to modify the configuration class since it's
deliberately lightweight and flexible.

<a name="system"> </a>

## System

An instance of a system object consists of a number of **stages**, some
**data**, and normally a **config** object.


### Pre-baked systems

We can create a system from an existing 'pre-baked system'. These include a
ready made set of data, a list of stages, and a config.

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
```

We can override what's provided, and include our own data, and / or
configuration, in such a system:

```python
system=futures_system(data=my_data)
system=futures_system(config=my_config)
system=futures_system(data=my_data, config=my_config)
```

Finally we can also create our own [trading rules object](#rules), and pass
that in. This is useful for interactive model development. If for example we've
just written a new rule on the fly:

```python
my_rules=dict(rule=a_new_rule)
system=futures_system(trading_rules=my_rules) ## we probably need a new configuration as well here if we're using fixed forecast weights
```


<a name="futures_system"> </a>

#### [Futures system for chapter 15](/systems/provided/futures_chapter15/basesystem.py)

This system implements the framework in chapter 15 of my book.

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
```


Effectively it implements the following;

```python
data=csvFuturesSimData() ## or the data object that has been passed
config=Config("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futuresconfig.yaml") ## or the config object that is passed

## Optionally the user can provide trading_rules (something which can be parsed as a set of trading rules); however this defaults to None in which case
##     the rules in the config will be used.

system=System([Account(), Portfolios(), PositionSizing(), RawData(), ForecastCombine(),
                   ForecastScaleCap(), Rules(trading_rules)], data, config)
```

<a name="estimated_system"> </a>

#### [Estimated system for chapter 15](/systems/provided/futures_chapter15/estimatedsystem.py)


This system implements the framework in chapter 15 of my book, but includes
estimation of forecast scalars, instrument and forecast diversification
multiplier, instrument and forecast weights.


```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.estimatedsystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
```


Effectively it implements the following;

```python
data=csvFuturesSimData() ## or the data object that has been passed
config=Config("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futuresestimateconfig.yaml") ## or the config object that is passed

## Optionally the user can provide trading_rules (something which can be parsed as a set of trading rules); however this defaults to None in which case
##     the rules in the config will be used.

system=System([Account(), Portfolios(), PositionSizing(), RawData(), ForecastCombine(),
                   ForecastScaleCap(), Rules(trading_rules)], data, config)
```

The key configuration differences from the standard system are that the
estimation parameters:
 - `use_forecast_scale_estimates`
 - `use_forecast_weight_estimates`
 - `use_instrument_weight_estimates`
-  `use_forecast_div_mult_estimates`
-  `use_instrument_div_mult_estimates`

 ... are all set to `True`.

Warning: Be careful about changing a system from estimated to non estimated 'on
the fly' by varying the estimation parameters (in the form use_*_estimates).
See [persistence of 'switched' stage objects](#switch_persistence) for more
information.


### Using the system object

The system object doesn't do very much in itself, except provide access to its
'child' stages, its cache, and a limited number of methods. The child stages
are all attributes of the parent system.

#### Accessing child stages, data, and config within a system


For example to get the final portfolio level 'notional' position, which is in
the child stage named `portfolio`:

```python
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")
```

We can also access the methods in the data object that is part of every system:

```python
system.data.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR")
```

For a list of all the methods in a system and its stages see [stage methods](#table_system_stage_methods). Alternatively:
```python
system ## lists all the stages
system.accounts.methods() ## lists all the methods in a particular stage
system.data.methods() ## also works for data
```



We can also access or change elements of the config object:

```python
system.config.trading_rules
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.2
```

#### System methods

The base system only has a public few methods of it's own (apart from those used for
caching, described below):

`system.get_instrument_list()` This will get the list of instruments in the
system, either from the config object if it contains instrument weights, or
from the data object.


These methods also get lists of instruments, see [instrument documentation](/instruments.md) for more.
```
get_list_of_bad_markets
get_list_of_markets_not_trading_but_with_data
get_list_of_duplicate_instruments_to_remove
get_list_of_ignored_instruments_to_remove
get_list_of_instruments_to_remove
get_list_of_markets_with_trading_restrictions'
```

`system.log` provides access to the system's log. See [logging](#logging) for more 
details.

<a name="caching"> </a>

### System Caching and pickling

Pulling in data and calculating all the various stages in a system can be a
time consuming process. So the code supports caching. When we first ask for
some data by calling a stage method, like
`system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")`, the system first checks to
see if it has already pre-calculated this figure. If not then it will calculate
the figure from scratch. This in turn may involve calculating preliminary
figures that are needed for this position, unless they've already been
pre-calculated. So for example to get a combined forecast, we'd already need to
have all the individual forecasts from different trading rule variations for a
particular instrument. Once we've calculated a particular data point, which
could take some time, it is stored in the system object cache (along with any
intermediate results we also calculated). The next time we ask for it will be
served up immediately.

Most of the time you shouldn't need to worry about caching. If you're testing
different configurations, or updating or changing your data, you just have to
make sure you recreate the system object from scratch after each change. A new
system object will have an empty cache.

Cache labels

```python
from copy import copy
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

system=futures_system()
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")

## What's in the cache?
system.cache.get_cache_refs_for_instrument("EDOLLAR")

   [_get_forecast_scalar_fixed in forecastScaleCap for instrument EDOLLAR [carry] , get_raw_forecast in rules for instrument EDOLLAR [ewmac32_128]  ...


## Let's make a change to the config:
system.config.forecast_div_multiplier=0.1

## This will produce the same result, as we've cached the result
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")

## but if we make a new system with the new config...
system=futures_system(config=system.config)

## check the cache is empty:
system.cache.get_cache_refs_for_instrument("EDOLLAR")

## ... we get a different result
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")

## We can also turn caching off
## First clear the cache
system.cache.clear()

## ... should be nothing here
system.cache.get_cache_refs_for_instrument("EDOLLAR")

## Now turn off caching
system.cache.set_caching_off()

## Now after getting some data:
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")

##.... the cache is still empty
system.cache.get_cache_refs_for_instrument("EDOLLAR")

## if we change the config
system.config.forecast_div_multiplier=100.0

## ... then the result will be different without needing to create a new system
system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")
```

### Pickling and unpickling saved cache data

It can take a while to backtest a large system. It's quite useful to be able to
save the contents of the cache and reload it later. I use the python pickle
module to do this.

For boring python related reasons not all elements in the cache will be saved.
The accounting information, and the optimisation functions used when estimating
weights, will be excluded and won't be reloaded.


```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

system = futures_system()
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## does a whole bunch of calculations that will be saved in the cache. A bit slow...

system.cache.get_itemnames_for_stage("accounts") # includes 'portfolio'

# if I asked for this again, it's superfast
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe()

## save it down
system.cache.pickle("private.this_system_name.system.pck") ## Using the 'dot' method to identify files in the workspace. use any file extension you like


## Now in a new session
system = futures_system()
system.cache.get_items_with_data() ## check empty cache

system.cache.unpickle("private.this_system_name.system.pck")

system.cache.get_items_with_data() ## Cache is now populated. Any existing data in system instance would have been removed.
system.get_itemnames_for_stage("accounts") ## now doesn't include ('accounts', 'portfolio', 'percentageTdelayfillTroundpositionsT')

system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## Not coming from the cache, but this will run much faster and reuse many previous calculations

```

See [here](#filenames) for how to specify filenames in pysystemtrade.


### Advanced caching

It's also possible to selectively delete certain cached items, whilst keeping
the rest of the system intact. You shouldn't do this without understanding
[stage wiring](#stage_wiring). You need to have a good knowledge of the various
methods in each stage, to understand the downstream implications of either
deleting or keeping a particular data value.

There are four attributes of data stored in the cache:

1. Unprotected data that is deleted from the cache on request
2. Protected data that wouldn't normally be deletable. Outputs of lengthy
   estimations are usually protected
3. Data specific to a particular instrument (can be protected or unprotected)
4. Data which applies to the whole system; or at least to multiple instruments
   (can be protected or unprotected)

Protected items and items common across the system wouldn't normally be deleted
since they are usually the slowest things to calculate.

For example here are is how we'd check the cache after getting a notional
position (which generates a huge number of intermediate results). Notice the
way we can filter and process lists of cache keys.


```python
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EDOLLAR")

system.cache.get_items_with_data() ## this list everything.
system.cache.get_cacherefs_for_stage("portfolio") ## lists everything in a particular stage
system.cache.get_items_with_data().filter_by_stage_name("portfolio") ## more idiomatic way
system.cache._get_protected_items() ## lists protected items
system.cache.get_items_with_data().filter_by_instrument_code("EDOLLAR") ## list items with data for an instrument
system.cache.get_cache_refs_across_system() ## list items that run across the whole system or multiple instruments

system.cache.get_items_with_data().filter_by_itemname('get_capped_forecast').unique_list_of_instrument_codes() ## lists all instruments with a capped forecast

```

Now if we want to selectively clear parts of the cache we could do one of the
following:

```python
system.cache.delete_items_for_instrument(instrument_code) ## deletes everything related to an instrument: NOT protected, or across system items
system.cache.delete_items_across_system() ## deletes everything that runs across the system; NOT protected, or instrument specific items
system.cache.delete_all_items() ## deletes all items relating to an instrument or across the system; NOT protected
system.cache.delete_items_for_stage(stagename) ## deletes all items in a particular stage, NOT protected

## Be careful with these:
system.cache.delete_items_for_instrument(instrument_code, delete_protected=True) ## deletes everything related to an instrument including protected; NOT across system items
system.cache.delete_items_across_system(delete_protected=True) ## deletes everything including protected items that runs across the system; NOT instrument specific items
## If you run these you will empty the cache completely:
system.cache.delete_item(itemname) ## delete everything in the cache for a paticluar item - including protected and across system items
system.cache.delete_all_items(delete_protected=True) ## deletes all items relating to an instrument or across the system - including protected items
system.cache.delete_items_for_stage(stagename, delete_protected=True) ## deletes all items in a particular stage - including protected items
system.cache.clear()
```




#### Advanced Caching when backtesting.

Creating a new system might be very slow. For example estimating the forecast
scalars, and instrument and forecast weights from scratch will take time,
especially if you're bootstrapping. For this reason they're protected from
cache deletion.

A possible workflow might be:

1. Create a basic version of the system, with all the instruments and trading
   rules that you need.
2. Run a backtest. This will optimise the instrument and forecast weights, and
   estimate forecast scalars (to really speed things up here you could use a
   faster method like shrinkage. See the section on
   [optimisation](#optimisation) for more information.).
3. Change and modify the system as desired. Make sure you change the config
   object that is embedded within the system. Don't create a new system object.
4. After each change, run `system.delete_all_items()` before backtesting the
   system again. Anything that is protected won't be re-estimated, speeding up
   the process.
5. Back to step 3, until you're happy with the results (but beware of implicit
   overfitting!)
6. run `system.delete_all_items(delete_protected=True)` or equivalently create
   a new system object
7. Run a backtest. This will re-estimate everything from scratch for the final
   version of your system.

Another reason to use caching would be if you want to do your initial
exploration with just a subset of the data.

1. Create a basic version of the system, with a subset of the instruments and
   trading rules that you need.
2. .... 6 as before
7. Add the rest of your instruments to your data set.
8. Run a backtest. This will re-estimate everything from scratch for the final
   version of your system, including the expanded instrument weights.

Here's a simple example of using caching in system development:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()

# step 2
system.accounts.portfolio().curve() ## effectively runs an entire backtest

# step 3
new_idm=1.1 ## new IDM
system.config.instrument_div_multiplier=new_idm

# step 4
system.cache.delete_all_items() ## protected items won't be affected
system.accounts.portfolio().curve() ## re-run the backtest

# Assuming we're happy- move on to step 6
system.cache.delete_all_items(delete_protected=True)

## or alternatively recreate the system using the modified config:
new_config=system.config
system=futures_system(config=new_config)

## Step 7
system.accounts.portfolio().curve() ## re-run the final backtest

```


#### Advanced caching behaviour with a live trading system

Although the project doesn't yet include a live trading system, the caching
behaviour of the system object will make it more suitable for a live system. If
we're trading slowly enough, eg every day, we might be want to to do this
overnight:

1. Get new prices for all instruments
2. Save these in wherever our data object is looking
3. Create a new system object from scratch
4. Run the system by asking for optimal positions for all instruments

Step 4 might be very involved and slow, but markets are closed so that's fine.

Then we do the following throughout the day:

5. Wait for a new price to come in (perhaps through a message bus)
6. So we don't subsequently use stale prices delete everything specific to that
   instrument with `system.delete_items_for_instrument(instrument_code)`
7. Re-calculate the optimal positions for this instrument
8. This is then passed to our trading algo

Because we've deleted everything specific to the instrument we'll recalculate
the positions, and all intermediate stages, using the new price. However we
won't have to repeat lengthy calculations that cut across instruments, such as
correlation estimates, risk overlays, cross sectional data or weight
estimation. That can wait till our next overnight run.


### Very advanced: Caching in new or modified code

If you're going to write new methods for stages (or a complete new stage) you
need to follow some rules to keep caching behaviour consistent.

The golden rule is a particular value should only be cached once, in a single
place.

So the data object methods should never cache; they should just behave like
'pipes' passing data through to system stages on request. This saves the hassle
of having to write methods which delete items in the data object cache as well
as the system cache.

Similarly most stages contain 'input' methods, which do no calculations but get
the 'output' from an earlier stage and then 'serve' it to the rest of the
stage. These exist to simplify changing the internal wiring of a stage and
reduce the coupling between methods from different stages. These should also
never cache; or again we'll be caching the same data multiple times ( see
[stage wiring](#stage_wiring) ).

You should cache as early as possible; so that all the subsequent stages that
need that data item already have it. Avoid looping back, where a stage uses
data from a later stage, as you may end up with infinite recursion.

The cache 'lives' in the parent system object in the attribute `system.cache`,
*not* the stage with the relevant method. There are standard functions which
will check to see if an item is cached in the system, and then call a function
to calculate it if required (see below). To make this easier when a stage
object joins a system it gains an attribute self.parent, which will be the
'parent' system.

Think carefully about whether your method should create data that is protected
from casual cache deletion. As a rule anything that cuts across instruments and
/ or changes slowly should be protected. Here are the current list of protected
items:

- Estimated Forecast scalars
- Estimated Forecast weights
- Estimated Forecast diversification multiplier
- Estimated Forecast correlations
- Estimated Instrument diversification multiplier
- Estimated Instrument weights
- Estimated Instrument correlations

To this list I'd add any cross sectional data, and anything that measures
portfolio risk (not yet implemented in this project).

Also think about whether you're going to cache any complex objects that
`pickle` might have trouble with, like class instances. You need to flag these
up as problematic.

Caching is implemented (as of version 0.14.0 of this project) by python
decorators attached to methods in the stage objects. There are four decorators
used by the code:

- `@input` - no caching done, input method see [stage wiring](#stage_wiring)
- `@dont_cache` - no caching done, used for very trivial calculations that
  aren't worth caching
- `@diagnostic()` - caching done within the body of a stage
- `@output()` - caching done producing an output

Notice the latter two decorators are always used with brackets, the former
without. Labelling your code with the `@input` or `@dont_cache` decorators has
no effect whatsoever, and is purely a labelling convention.

Similarly the `@diagnostic` and `@output` decorators perform exactly the same
way; it's just helpful to label your [stage wiring](#stage_wiring) and make
output functions clear.

The latter two decorators take two optional keyword arguments which default to
False `@diagnostic(protected=False, not_pickable=False)`. Set `protected=True`
if you want to stop casual deletion of the results of a method. Set
`not_pickable=True` if the results of a method will be a complex nested object
that pickle will struggle with.

Here are some fragments of code from the forecast_combine.py file showing cache
decorators in use:

```python

    @dont_cache

### Creating a new 'pre-baked' system

It's worth creating a new pre-baked system if you're likely to want to repeat a
backtest, or when you've settled on a system you want to paper or live trade.

The elements of a new pre-baked system will be:

1. New stages, or a different choice of existing stages.
2. A set of data (either new or existing)
3. A configuration file
4. A python function that loads the above elements, and returns a system object

To remain organised it's good practice to save your configuration file and any
python functions you need into a directory like
`pysystemtrade/private/this_system_name/` (you'll need to create a couple of
directories first). If you plan to contribute to github, just be careful to
avoid adding 'private' to your commit ( [you may want to read
this](https://24ways.org/2013/keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-private-on-github/)
). If you have novel data you're using for this system, you may also want to
save it in the same directory.

Then it's a case of creating the python function. Here is an extract from the
[futuressystem for chapter
15](/systems/provided/futures_chapter15/basesystem.py)

```python
## We probably need these to get our data

from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config

## We now import all the stages we need
from systems.forecasting import Rules
from systems.basesystem import System
from systems.forecast_combine import ForecastCombine
from systems.forecast_scale_cap import ForecastScaleCap
from systems.rawdata import RawData
from systems.positionsizing import PositionSizing
from systems.portfolio import Portfolios
from systems.accounts.accounts_stage import Account


def futures_system(data=None, config=None, trading_rules=None):
    if data is None:
        data = csvFuturesSimData()

    if config is None:
        config = Config("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futuresconfig.yaml")

    ## It's nice to keep the option to dynamically load trading rules but if you prefer you can remove this and set rules=Rules() here
    rules = Rules(trading_rules)

    ## build the system
    system = System([Account(), Portfolios(), PositionSizing(), RawData(), ForecastCombine(),
                     ForecastScaleCap(), rules], data, config)

    return system
```


### Changing or making a new System class

It shouldn't be necessary to modify the `System()` class or create new ones.


<a name="stage_general"> </a>

## Stages

A *stage* within a system does part of the multiple steps of calculation that
are needed to ultimately come up with the optimal positions, and hence the
account curve, for the system. So the backtesting or live trading process
effectively happens within the stage objects.

We define the stages in a system when we create it, by passing a list of stage
objects as the first argument:

```python
from systems.forecasting import Rules
from systems.basesystem import System
data=None ## this won't do anything useful

my_system=System([Rules()], data)
```

(This step is often hidden when we use 'pre-baked' systems)

We can see what stages are in a system just by printing it:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system
```

```
System with stages: accounts, portfolio, positionSize, rawdata, combForecast, forecastScaleCap, rules
```

Stages are attributes of the main system:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.rawdata
```

```
SystemStage 'rawdata'
```

So we can access the data methods of each stage:

```python
system.rawdata.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR").tail(5)
```

```
              price
2015-04-16  97.9350
2015-04-17  97.9400
2015-04-20  97.9250
2015-04-21  97.9050
2015-04-22  97.8325
```

`system.rawdata.log` provides access to the log for the stage rawdata, and so
on. See [logging](#logging) for more details.



<a name="stage_wiring"> </a>

### Stage 'wiring'

It's worth having a basic understanding of how the stages within a system are
'wired' together. Furthermore if you're going to modify or create new code, or
use [advanced system caching](#caching), you're going to need to understand
this properly.

What actually happens when we call
`system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")` in the pre-baked futures
system? Well this in turn will call other methods in this stage, and they will
call methods in previous stages,.. and so on until we get back to the
underlying data. We can represent this with a diagram:

- `system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")`
  - `system.combForecast.get_forecast_diversification_multiplier("EDOLLAR")`
  - `system.combForecast.get_forecast_weights("EDOLLAR")`
  - `system.combForecast.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))` etc
    - `system.forecastScaleCap.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))` etc
      - `system.forecastScaleCap.get_forecast_cap("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")` etc
      - `system.forecastScaleCap.get_scaled_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")`
        etc
        - `system.forecastScaleCap.get_forecast_scalar("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")`
          etc
        - `system.forecastScaleCap.get_raw_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")` etc
          - `system.rules.get_raw_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")` etc
            - `system.data.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR")`
            - `system.rawdata.get_daily_returns_volatility("EDOLLAR")`
              - (further stages to calculate volatility omitted)

A system effectively consists of a 'tree' of which the above shows only a small
part. When we ask for a particular 'leaf' of the tree, the data travels up the
'branches' of the tree, being cached as it goes.

The stage 'wiring' is how the various stages communicate with each other.
Generally a stage will consist of:

1. *Input* methods that get data from another stage without doing any further
   calculation
2. Internal *diagnostic* methods that do intermediate calculations within a
   stage (these may be private, but are usually left exposed so they can be
   used for diagnostic purposes)
3. *Output* methods that other stages will use for their inputs.

For example consider the first few items in the list above. Let's label them
appropriately:

- **Output (combForecast)**:
  `system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("EDOLLAR")`
  - **Internal (combForecast)**:
    `system.combForecast.get_forecast_diversification_multiplier("EDOLLAR")`
  - **Internal (combForecast)**:
    `system.combForecast.get_forecast_weights("EDOLLAR")`
  - **Input (combForecast)**:
    `system.combForecast.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))` etc
    - **Output (forecastScaleCap)**:
      `system.forecastScaleCap.get_capped_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8"))` etc

This approach (which you can also think of as the stage "API") is used to make
it easier to modify the code - we can change the way a stage works internally,
or replace it with a new stage with the same name, but as long as we keep the
output method intact we don't need to mess around with any other stage.



### Writing new stages

If you're going to write a new stage (completely new, or to replace an existing
stage) you need to keep the following in mind:

1. New stages should inherit from [`SystemStage`](/systems/stage.py)
2. Modified stages should inherit from the existing stage you're modifying. For
   example if you create a new way of calculating forecast weights then you
   should inherit from [class `ForecastCombine`](/systems/forecast_combine.py),
   and then override the `get_forecast_weights` method; whilst keeping the
   other methods unchanged.
3. Completely new stages will need a unique name; this is specified in the
   object method `_name()`. They can then be accessed with `system.stage_name`
4. Modified stages should use the same name as their parent, or the wiring will
   go haywire.
5. Think about whether you need to protect part of the system cache for this
   stage output [system caching](#caching) from casual deletion.
6. Similarly if you're going to cache complex objects that won't pickle easily
   (like accountCurve objects) you need to put a `not_pickable=True` in the
   decorator call.
7. Use non-cached input methods to get data from other stages. Be wary of
   accessing internal methods in other stages; try to stick to output methods
   only.
8. Use cached input methods to get data from the system data object (since this
   is the first time it will be cached). Again only access public methods of
   the system data object.
9. Use cached methods for internal diagnostic and output methods(see [system
   caching](#caching) ).
10. If you want to store attributes within a stage, then prefix them with _ and
    include a method to access or change them. Otherwise the methods() method
    will return attributes as well as methods.
11. Internal methods should be public if they could be used for diagnostics,
    otherwise prefix them with _ to make them private.
12. The doc string for input and output methods should clearly identify them as
    such. This is to make viewing the wiring easier.
13. The doc string at the head of the stage should specify the input methods
    (and where they take their input from), and the output methods
14. The doc string should also explain what the stage does, and the name of the
    stage
15. Really big stages should be separated across multiple classes (and possibly
    files), using multiple inheritance to glue them together. See the [accounts
    stage](/systems/account.py) for an example.

New stage code should be included in a subdirectory of the systems package (as
for [futures raw data](/systems/futures/) ) or in your [private
directory](/private/).

### Specific stages

The standard list of stages is as follows. The default class is given below, as
well as the system attribute used to access the stage.

1. [Raw data:](#stage_rawdata) [class RawData](/systems/rawdata.py)
   `system.rawdata`
2. [Forecasting:](#rules) [class Rules](/systems/forecasting.py) `system.rules`
   (chapter 7 of my book)
3. [Scale and cap forecasts:](#stage_scale) [class
   ForecastScaleCap](/systems/forecast_scale_cap.py)
   `system.forecastScaleCap`(chapter 7)
4. [Combine forecasts:](#stage_combine) [class
   ForecastCombine](/systems/forecast_combine.py) `system.combForecast`
   (chapter 8)
5. [Calculate subsystem positions:](#position_scale) [class
   PositionSizing](/systems/positionsizing.py) `system.positionSize` (chapters
   9 and 10)
6. [Create a portfolio across multiple instruments:](#stage_portfolio) [class
   Portfolios](/systems/portfolio.py) `system.portfolio` (chapter 11)
7. [Calculate performance:](#accounts_stage) [class
   Account](/systems/account.py) `system.accounts`

Each of these stages is described in more detail below.

<a name="stage_rawdata"> </a>

### Stage: Raw data

The raw data stage is used to pre-process data for calculating trading rules,
scaling positions, or anything else we might need. Good reasons to include something
in raw data are:

1. If it is used multiple times, eg price volatility
2. To provide better diagnostics and visibility in the system, eg the
   intermediate steps required to calculate the carry rule for futures


#### Using the standard [RawData class](/systems/rawdata.py)

The base RawData class includes methods to get instrument prices, daily
returns, volatility, and normalised returns (return over volatility).

As we are trading futures the raw data class has some extra methods needed to calculate the carry
rule for futures, and to expose the intermediate calculations.

(Versions prior to 1.06 had a separate FuturesRawData class)

<a name="vol_calc"> </a>

##### Volatility calculation

There are two types of volatility in my trading systems:

1. Price difference volatility eg sigma (Pt - Pt-1)
2. Percentage return volatility eg sigma (Pt - Pt -1 / P*t-1)

The first kind is used in trading rules to normalise the forecast into
something proportional to Sharpe Ratio. The second kind is used to scale
positions. In both cases we use a 'stitched' price to work out price
differences. So in futures we splice together futures contracts as we roll,
shifting them according to the Panama method. Similarly if the system dealt
with cash equities, it would handle ex-dividend dates in the same way. If we
didn't do this, but just used the 'natural' price (the raw price of the
contract we're trading) to calculate returns, we'd get sharp returns on rolls.

In fact stitched prices are used by default in the system; since they make more
sense for trading rules that usually prefer smoother prices without weird
jumps. Nearly all the methods in raw data that mention price are referring to
the stitched price.

However when working out percentage returns we absolutely don't want to use the
'stitched' price as the denominator. For positive carry assets stitched prices
will increase over time; this means they will be small or even negative in the
past and the percentage returns will be large or have the wrong sign.

For this reason there is a special method in the data class called
`daily_denominator_price`. This tells the code what price to use for the P* in
the calculation above. As we are trading futures this uses the raw price of the
current contract.

The other point to note is that the price difference volatility calculation is
configurable through `config.volatility_calculation`.

The default function used is a robust EWMA volatility calculator with the
following configurable attributes:

- 35 day span
- Needs 10 periods to generate a value
- Will floor any values less than 0.0000000001
- Applies a further vol floor which:
  - Calculates the 5% percentile of vol using a 500 day moving average (needing
    100 periods to generate a value)
  - Floors any vol below that level

YAML:
```
volatility_calculation:
  func: "sysquant.estimators.vol.robust_vol_calc"
  days: 35
  min_periods: 10
  vol_abs_min: 0.0000000001
  vol_floor: True
  floor_min_quant: 0.05
  floor_min_periods: 100
  floor_days: 500

```

If you're considering using your own function please see [configuring defaults
for your own functions](#config_function_defaults)




#### New or modified raw data classes

It would make sense to create new raw data classes for new types of assets, or
to get more visibility inside trading rule calculations.

For example:

1. To work out the quality factor for an equity value system, based on raw
   accounting ratios
2. To work out the moving averages to be used in an EWMAC trading rule, so they
   can be viewed for diagnostic purposes.

For new asset classes in particular you should think hard about what you should
override the `daily_denominator_price` (see discussion on volatility
calculation above).

<a name="rules"> </a>

### Stage: Rules

Trading rules are at the heart of a fully systematic trading system. This stage
description is different from the others; and will be in the form of a tutorial
around creating trading rules.

The base class, Rules() [is here](/systems/forecasting.py); and it shouldn't be
necessary to modify this class.

<a name="TradingRules"> </a>

### Trading rules

A trading rule consists of:

- a function
- some data (specified as positional arguments)
- some optional control arguments (specified as key word arguments)

So the function must be something like these:

```python
def trading_rule_function(data1):
   ## do something with data1

def trading_rule_function(data1, arg1=default_value):
   ## do something with data1
   ## controlled by value of arg1

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2):
   ## do something with data1 and data2

def trading_rule_function(data1, data2, arg1=default_value, arg2=default_value):
   ## do something with data1
   ## controlled by value of arg1 and arg2

```
... and so on.

At a minimum we need to know the function, since other arguments are optional,
and if no data is specified the instrument price is used. A rule specified with
only the function is a 'bare' rule. It should take only one data argument which
is price, and have no other arguments that need new parameter values.

In this project there is a specific [TradingRule
class](/systems/forecasting.py). A `TradingRule` instance contains 3 elements -
a function, a list of any data the function needs, and a dict of any other
arguments that can be passed to the function.

The function can either be the actual function, or a relative reference to it
eg `systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac` (this is useful when a
configuration is created from a file). Data must always be in the form of
references to attributes and methods of the system object, eg
`data.daily_prices` or `rawdata.get_daily_prices`. Either a single data item,
or a list must be passed. Other arguments are in the form a dictionary.

We can create trading rules in a number of different ways. I've noticed that
different people find different ways of defining rules more natural than
others, hence the deliberate flexibility here.

Bare rules which only consist of a function can be defined as follows:

```python

from systems.trading_rules import TradingRule

TradingRule(ewmac)  ## with the actual function
TradingRule("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac")  ## string reference to the function
```

We can also add data and other arguments. Data is always a list of str, or a
single str. Other arguments are always a dict.

```python
TradingRule(ewmac, data='rawdata.get_daily_prices', other_args=dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8))
```

Multiple data is fine, and it's okay to omit data or other_args:

```python
TradingRule(some_rule, data=['rawdata.get_daily_prices','data.get_raw_price'])
```

Sometimes it's easier to specify the rule 'en bloc'. You can do this with a 3
tuple. Notice here we're specifying the function with a string, and listing
multiple data items:

```python
TradingRule(("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac", ['rawdata.get_daily_prices','data.get_raw_price'], dict(Lfast=3, Lslow=12)))
```

You can also specify rules with a dict. If using a dict keywords can be omitted
(but not `function`).

```python
TradingRule(dict(function="systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac", data=['rawdata.get_daily_prices','data.get_raw_price']))
```

Note if you use an 'en bloc' method, and also include the `data` or
`other_args` arguments in your call to `TradingRule`, you'll get a warning.

The dictionary method is used when configuration objects are read from YAML
files; these contain the trading rules in a nested dict.

YAML: (example)
```
trading_rules:
  ewmac2_8:
     function: systems.futures.rules.ewmac
     data:
         - "data.daily_prices"
         - "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"
     other_args:
         Lfast: 2
         Lslow: 8
     forecast_scalar: 10.6
```

Note that *`forecast_scalar`* isn't strictly part of the trading rule
definition, but if included here will be used instead of the separate
`config.forecast_scalar` parameter (see the [next stage](#stage_scale) ).

#### Data and data arguments

All the items in the `data` list passed to a trading rule are string references to methods in the system object that (usually) take a single argument, the instrument code. In theory these could be anywhere in the system object, but by convention they should only be in `system.rawdata` or `system.data` (if they are in stages that call the rules stage, you will get infinite recursion and things will break), with perhaps occasional reference to `system.get_instrument_list()`. The advantage of using methods in `rawdata` is that these are cached, and can be re-used. It's strongly recommended that you use methods in `rawdata` for trading rules.

What if you want to pass arguments to the data method? For example, you might want to pre-calculate the moving averages of different lengths in `rawdata` and then reuse them to save time. Or you might want to calculate skew over a given time period for all markets and then take a cross sectional average to use in a relative value rule.

We can do this by passing special kinds of `other_args` which are pre-fixed with underscores, eg "_". If an element in the other_ags dictionary has no underscores, then it is passed to the trading rule function as a keyword argument. If it has one leading underscore eg "_argname", then it is passed to the first method in the data list as a keyword argument. If it has two underscores eg "__argname", then it is passed to the second method in the data list, and so on.

Let's see how we could implement the moving average example:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import *
from systems.trading_rules import TradingRule

data = csvFuturesSimData()
config = Config(
   "systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futuresconfig.yaml")


# First let's add a new method to our rawdata
# As well as the usual instrument_code this has a keyword argument, span, which we are going to access in our trading rule definitions
class newRawData(RawData):
   def moving_average(self, instrument_code, span=8):
      price = self.get_daily_prices(instrument_code)
      return price.ewm(span=span).mean()


# Now for our new trading rule. Multiplier is a trivial variable, included to show you can mix other arguments and data arguments
def new_ewma(fast_ewma, slow_ewma, vol, multiplier=1):
   raw_ewmac = fast_ewma - slow_ewma

   raw_ewmac = raw_ewmac * multiplier

   return raw_ewmac / vol.ffill()


# Now we define our first trading rule. Notice that data gets two kinds of moving average, but the first one will have span 2 and the second span 8
trading_rule1 = TradingRule(dict(function=new_ewma, data=['rawdata.moving_average', 'rawdata.moving_average',
                                                          'rawdata.daily_returns_volatility'],
                                 other_args=dict(_span=2, __span=8, multiplier=1)))

# The second trading rule reuses one of the ewma, but uses a default value for the multiplier and the first ewma span (not great practice, but illustrates what is possible)
trading_rule2 = TradingRule(dict(function=new_ewma, data=['rawdata.moving_average', 'rawdata.moving_average',
                                                          'rawdata.daily_returns_volatility'],
                                 other_args=dict(__span=32)))

rules = Rules(dict(ewmac2_8=trading_rule1, ewmac8_32=trading_rule2))

system = System([
   Account(), Portfolios(), PositionSizing(), newRawData(),
   ForecastCombine(), ForecastScaleCap(), rules
], data, config)

# This will now work in the usual way
system.rules.get_raw_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac8_32")
system.rules.get_raw_forecast("EDOLLAR", "ewmac2_8")
```

Notes: methods passed as data pointers must only have a single argument plus optionally keyword arguments. Multiple non keyword arguments will break. Also in specifying the other arguments you don't have to provide keyword arguments for all data elements, or for the trading rule: all are optional.


### The Rules class, and specifying lists of trading rules

We can pass a trading rule, or a group of rules, into the class Rules() in a
number of ways.

#### Creating lists of rules from a configuration object

Normally we'd pass in the list of rules form a configuration object. Let's have
a look at an incomplete version of the pre-baked chapter 15 futures system.

```python
## We probably need these to get our data

from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
from systems.basesystem import System

## We now import all the stages we need
from systems.forecasting import Rules
from systems.rawdata import RawData

data=csvFuturesSimData()
config=Config("systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futuresconfig.yaml")

rules=Rules()

## build the system
system=System([rules, RawData()], data, config)

rules
```

```
<snip>
Exception: A Rules stage needs to be part of a System to identify trading rules, unless rules are passed when object created
```

```python
## Once part of a system we can see the rules
forecast=system.rules.get_raw_forecast('EDOLLAR','ewmac2_8')
rules
```

```
Rules object with rules ewmac32_128, ewmac64_256, ewmac16_64, ewmac8_32, ewmac4_16, ewmac2_8, carry
```

```python
##
rules.trading_rules()
```

```
{'carry': TradingRule; function: <function carry at 0xb2e0f26c>, data: rawdata.daily_annualised_roll, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: smooth_days,
 'ewmac16_64': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac2_8': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac32_128': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac4_16': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac64_256': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow,
 'ewmac8_32': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac at 0xb2e0f224>, data: rawdata.daily_prices, rawdata.daily_returns_volatility and other_args: Lfast, Lslow}
```


What actually happens when we run this? (this is a little complex but worth
understanding).

1. The `Rules` class is created with no arguments.
2. When the `Rules` object is first created it is 'empty' - it doesn't have a list of valid *processed* trading rules.
3. We create the `system` object. This means that all the stages can see the system, in particular they can see the configuration
4. `get_raw_forecast` is called, and looks for the trading rule "ewmac2_8". It gets this by calling the method `get_trading_rules`
5. When the method `get_trading_rules` is called it looks to see if there is a *processed* dict of trading rules
6. The first time the method `get_trading_rules` is called there won't be a processed list. So it looks for something to process
7. First it will look to see if anything was passed when the instance rules of the `Rules()` class was created
8. Since we didn't pass anything instead it processes what it finds in `system.config.trading_rules` - a nested dict, keynames rule variation names.
9. The `Rules` instance now has processed rule names in the form of a dict, keynames rule variation names, each element containing a valid `TradingRule` object



#### Interactively passing a list of trading rules

Often when we're working in development mode we won't have worked up a proper
config. To get round this we can pass a single trading rule or a set of trading
rules to the `Rules()` instance when we create it. If we pass a dict, then the
rules will be given appropriate names, otherwise if a single rule or a list is
passed they will be given arbitrary names "rule0", "rule1", ...

Also note that we don't have pass a single rule, list or dict of rules; we can
also pass anything that can be processed into a trading rule.

```python
## We now import all the stages we need
from systems.forecasting import Rules

## Pass a single rule. Any of the following are fine. See 'Trading rules' for more.
trading_rule=TradingRule(ewmac)
trading_rule=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8))
trading_rule=dict(function=ewmac, data='rawdata.get_daily_prices', other_args=dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8))

rules=Rules(trading_rule)
## The rule will be given an arbitrary name

## Pass a list of rules. Each rule can be defined how you like
trading_rule1=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8))
trading_rule2=dict(function=ewmac, other_args=dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16))

rules=Rules([trading_rule1, tradingrule2])
## The rules will be given arbitrary names

## Pass a dict of rules. Each rule can be defined how you like
trading_rule1=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8))
trading_rule2=dict(function=ewmac, other_args=dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16))

rules=Rules(dict(ewmac2_8=trading_rule1, ewmac4_16=tradingrule2))


```

#### Creating variations on a single trading rule

A very common development pattern is to create a trading rule with some
parameters that can be changed, and then to produce a number of variations. Two
functions are provided to make this easier.

```python

from systems.trading_rules import TradingRule, create_variations_oneparameter, create_variations

## Let's create 3 variations of ewmac
## The default ewmac has Lslow=128
## Let's keep that fixed and vary Lfast
rule = TradingRule("systems.provided.rules.ewmac.ewmac_forecast_with_defaults")
variations = create_variations_oneparameter(rule, [4, 10, 100], "ewmac_Lfast")

variations.keys()
```

```
dict_keys(['ewmac_Lfast_4', 'ewmac_Lfast_10', 'ewmac_Lfast_100'])
```


```python
## Now let's vary both Lslow and Lfast
rule=TradingRule("systems.provided.rules.ewmac.ewmac_forecast_with_defaults")

## each separate rule is specified by a dict. We could use a lambda to produce these automatically
variations=create_variations(rule, [dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8), dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16)], key_argname="Lfast")
variations.keys()
   dict_keys(['ewmac_Lfast_4', 'ewmac_Lfast_2'])

variations['Lfast_2'].other_args
   {'Lfast': 4, 'Lslow': 16}

```

We'd now create an instance of `Rules()`, passing variations in as an argument.

#### Using a newly created Rules() instance

Once we have our new rules object we can create a new system with it:

```python
## build the system
system=System([rules, RawData()], data, config)

```

It's generally a good idea to put new fixed forecast scalars (see [forecasting
scaling and capping](#stage_scale) ) and forecast weights into the config (see
[the combining stage](#stage_combine) ); although if you're estimating these
parameters automatically this won't be a problem. Or if you're just playing
with ideas you can live with the default forecast scale of 1.0, and you can
delete the forecast weights so that the system will default to using equal
weights:

```python
del(config.forecast_weights)
```



#### Passing trading rules to a pre-baked system function

If we've got a pre-baked system and a new set of trading rules we want to try
that aren't in a config, we can pass them into the system when it's created:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system

## we now create my_rules as we did above, for example
trading_rule1=(ewmac, 'rawdata.get_daily_prices', dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8))
trading_rule2=dict(function=ewmac, other_args=dict(Lfast=4, Lslow=16))

system=futures_system(trading_rules=dict(ewmac2_8=trading_rule1, ewmac4_16=tradingrule2)) ## we may need to change the configuration
```


#### Changing the trading rules in a system on the fly (advanced)

The workflow above has been to create a `Rules` instance (either empty, or
passing in a set of trading rules), then create a system that uses it. However
sometimes we might want to modify the list of trading rules in the system
object. For example you may have loaded a pre-baked system in (which will have
an empty `Rules()` instance and so be using the rules from the config). Rather
than replace that wholesale, you might want to drop one of the rules, add an
additional one, or change a rule that already exists.

To do this we need to directly access the private `_trading_rules` attribute
that stores **processed** trading rules in a dict. This means we can't pass in
any old rubbish that can be parsed into a trading rule as we did above; we need
to pass in actual `TradingRule` objects.

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
from systems.trading_rules import TradingRule

system = futures_system()

## Parse the existing rules in the config (not required if you're going to backtest first as this will call this method doing its normal business)
system.rules.trading_rules()

#############
## add a rule by accessing private attribute
new_rule = TradingRule(
   "systems.provided.futures_chapter15.rules.ewmac")  ## any form of [TradingRule](#TradingRule) is fine here
system.rules._trading_rules['new_rule'] = new_rule
#############


#############
## modify a rule with existing key 'ewmac2_8'
modified_rule = system.rules._trading_rules['ewmac2_8']
modified_rule.other_args['Lfast'] = 10

## We can also do:
## modified_rule.function=new_function
## modified_rule.data='data.get_raw_price'
##

system.rules._trading_rules['ewmac2_8'] = modified_rule
#############


#############
## delete a rule (not recommended)
## Removing the rule from the set of fixed forecast_weights or rule_variations (used for estimating forecast_weights) would have the same effect - and you need to do this anyway
## Rules which aren't in the list of variations or weights are not calculated, so there is no benefit in deleting a rule in terms of speed / space
##
system.rules._trading_rules.pop("ewmac2_8")
#############

```



<a name="stage_scale"> </a>

### Stage: Forecast scale and cap [ForecastScaleCap class](/systems/forecast_scale_cap.py)

This is a simple stage that performs two steps:

1. Scale forecasts so they have the right average absolute value, by multiplying
   raw forecasts by a forecast scalar
2. Cap forecasts at a maximum value


#### Using fixed weights (/systems/forecast_scale_cap.py)

The standard configuration uses fixed scaling and caps. It is included in
[standard futures system](#futures_system).

Forecast scalars are specific to each rule. Scalars can either be included in
the `trading_rules` or `forecast_scalars` part of the config. The former takes
precedence if both are included:

YAML: (example)
```
trading_rules:
  some_rule_name:
     function: systems.futures.rules.arbitrary_function
     forecast_scalar: 10.6

```

YAML: (example)
```
forecast_scalars:
   some_rule_name: 10.6
```


The forecast cap is also configurable, but must be the same for all rules:

YAML:
```
forecast_cap: 20.0
```

If entirely missing default values of 1.0 and 20.0 are used for the scale and
cap respectively.

<a name="scalar_estimate"> </a>

#### Calculating estimated forecasting scaling on the fly(/systems/forecast_scale_cap.py)

See [this blog
post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/01/pysystemtrader-estimated-forecast.html).

You may prefer to estimate your forecast scales from the available data. This
is often necessary if you have a new trading rule and have no idea at all what
the scaling should be. To do this you need to turn on estimation
`config.use_forecast_scale_estimates=True`. It is included in the pre-baked
[estimated futures system](#futures_system).

All the config parameters needed are stored in
`config.forecast_scalar_estimate`.

You can either estimate scalars for individual instruments, or using data
pooled across instruments. The config parameter `pool_instruments` determines
which option is used.

##### Pooled forecast scale estimate (default)

We do this if `pool_instruments=True`. This defaults to using the function
"sysquant.estimators.forecast_scalar.forecast_scalar", but this is configurable using the parameter
`func`. If you're changing this please see [configuring defaults for your own
functions](#config_function_defaults).

I strongly recommend using pooling, since it's always good to get more data.
The only reason not to use it is if you've been an idiot and designed a
forecast for which the scale is naturally different across instruments (see
chapter 7 of my book).

This function calculates a cross sectional median of absolute values, then
works out the scalar to get it 10, using a rolling moving average (so always
out of sample).

I also recommend using the defaults, a `window` size of 250000 (essentially
long enough so you're estimating with an expanding window) and `min_periods` of
500 (a couple of years of daily data; less than this and we'll get something
too unstable especially for a slower trading rule, more and we'll have to wait
too long to get a value). The other parameter of interest is `backfill` which
is boolean and defaults to True. This backfills the first scalar value found
back into the past so we don't lose any data; strictly speaking this is
cheating but we're not selecting the parameter for performance reasons so I for
one can sleep at night.

Note: The pooled estimate is [cached](#caching) as an 'across system',
non instrument specific, item.

##### Individual instrument forecast scale estimate

We do this if `pool_instruments=False`. Other parameters work in the same way.

Note: The estimate is [cached](#caching) separately for each instrument.


<a name="stage_combine"> </a>

### Stage: Forecast combine [ForecastCombine class](/systems/forecast_combine.py)

We now take a weighted average of forecasts using instrument weights, and
multiply by the forecast diversification multiplier.


#### Using fixed weights and multipliers(/systems/forecast_combine.py)

The default fixed weights and a fixed multiplier. It is included in the
pre-baked [standard futures system](#futures_system).

Both weights and multiplier are configurable.

Forecast weights can be (a) common across instruments, or (b) specified
differently for each instrument. If not included equal weights will be used.

YAML: (a)
```
forecast_weights:
     ewmac: 0.50
     carry: 0.50

```

YAML: (b)
```
forecast_weights:
     SP500:
      ewmac: 0.50
      carry: 0.50
     US10:
      ewmac: 0.10
      carry: 0.90

```

The diversification multiplier can also be (a) common across instruments, or
(b) we use a different one for each instrument (would be normal if instrument
weights were also different).


YAML: (a)
```
forecast_div_multiplier: 1.0

```

YAML: (b)
```
forecast_div_multiplier:
     SP500: 1.4
     US10:  1.1
```

Note that the `get_combined_forecast` method in the standard fixed base class
automatically adjusts forecast weights if different trading rules have
different start dates for their forecasts. It does not adjust the multiplier.
This means that in the past the multiplier will probably be too high.

#### Using estimated weights and diversification multiplier(/systems/forecast_combine.py)


This behaviour is included in the pre-baked [estimated futures
system](#futures_system). We switch to it by setting
`config.use_forecast_weight_estimates=True` and/or
`config.use_forecast_div_mult_estimates=True`.

##### Estimating the forecast weights

See [optimisation](#optimisation) for more information.


##### Removing expensive trading rules

See [optimisation](#optimisation) for more information.

##### Estimating the forecast diversification multiplier

See [estimating diversification multipliers](#divmult).

#### Forecast mapping

A new optional feature introduced in version 0.18.2 is *forecast mapping*. This is the non linear mapping discussed in [this blog post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/03/diversification-and-small-account-size.html) whereby we do not take a forecast until it has reached some threshold. Because this will reduce the standard deviation of our forecasts we compensate by ramping up the forecast more quickly until the raw forecast reaches the existing cap (which defaults to 20). This is probably illustrated better if we look at the non-linear mapping function:

```python
#This is syscore.algos.map_forecast_value
def map_forecast_value_scalar(x, threshold, capped_value, a_param, b_param):
    """
    Non linear mapping of x value; replaces forecast capping; with defaults will map 1 for 1

    We want to end up with a function like this, for raw forecast x and mapped forecast m,
        capped_value c and threshold_value t:

    if -t < x < +t: m=0
    if abs(x)>c: m=sign(x)*c*a
    if c < x < -t:   (x+t)*b
    if t < x < +c:   (x-t)*b

    :param x: value to map
    :param threshold: value below which map to zero
    :param capped_value: maximum value we want x to take (without non linear mapping)
    :param a_param: multiple at capped value
    :param b_param: slope
    :return: mapped x
    """
    x = float(x)
    if np.isnan(x):
        return x
    if abs(x)<threshold:
        return 0.0
    if x >= -capped_value and x <= -threshold:
        return b_param*(x+threshold)
    if x >= threshold and x <= capped_value:
        return b_param*(x-threshold)
    if abs(x)>capped_value:
        return sign(x)*capped_value*a_param

    raise Exception("This should cover all conditions!")

```

What values should we use for a,b and threshold (t)? We want to satisfy the following rules:

- a_param should be set so that we typically hold four contracts when the raw_forecast is at capped_value (see chapter 12 of my book, "Systematic Trading")
- We require b = (c*a)/(c-t)
- Given our parameters, and the distribution of the raw forecast (assumed to be Gaussian), the average absolute value of the final distribution should be unchanged.

These values aren't estimated by default, so you can use this external function:

```python
# Assuming futures_system already contains a system which has positions
from systems.diagoutput import systemDiag

sysdiag = systemDiag(futures_system)
sysdiag.forecast_mapping()
```

Parameters are specified by market as follows:

YAML:
```
forecast_mapping:
  AEX:
    a_param: 2.0
    b_param: 8.0
    threshold: 15.0
```

If the forecast_mapping key is missing from the configuration object, or the instrument is missing from the dict, then no mapping will be done (the raw forecast will remain unchanged). Also note that if a_param = b_param = 1, and threshold=0, then this is equivalent to no mapping.


### Stage: Position scaling

<a name="notional"> We now scale our positions according to our percentage
volatility target (chapters 9 and 10 of my book). At this stage we treat our
target, and therefore our account size, as fixed. So we ignore any compounding
of losses and profits. It's for this reason the I refer to the 'notional'
position. Later in the documentation I'll relax that assumption. </a>

#### Using the standard [PositionSizing class](/systems/positionsizing.py)

The annualised percentage volatility target, notional trading capital and
currency of trading capital are all configurable.

YAML:
```
percentage_vol_target: 16.0
notional_trading_capital: 1000000
base_currency: "USD"
```

Note that the stage code tries to get the percentage volatility of an
instrument from the rawdata stage. Since a rawdata stage might be omitted, it
can also fall back to calculating this from scratch using the data object and
the default volatility calculation method.



<a name="stage_portfolio"> </a>

### Stage: Creating portfolios [Portfolios class](/systems/portfolio.py)

The instrument weights and instrument diversification multiplier are used to
combine different instruments together into the final portfolio (chapter eleven
of my book).


#### Using fixed weights and instrument diversification multiplier(/systems/portfolio.py)

The default uses fixed weights and multiplier.

Both are configurable. If omitted equal weights will be used, and a multiplier
of 1.0

YAML:
```
instrument_weights:
    EDOLLAR: 0.5
    US10: 0.5
instrument_div_multiplier: 1.2

```

Note that the `get_instrument_weights` method in the standard fixed base class
automatically adjusts raw forecast weights if different instruments have
different start dates for their price history and forecasts. It does not adjust
the multiplier. This means that in the past the multiplier will probably be too
high.



#### Using estimated weights and instrument diversification multiplier(/systems/portfolio.py)

You can estimate the correct instrument diversification multiplier 'on the
fly', and also estimate instrument weights. This functionality is included in
the pre-baked [estimated futures system](#futures_system). It is accessed by
setting `config.use_instrument_weight_estimates=True` and/or
`config.use_instrument_div_mult_estimates=True`.

##### Estimating the instrument weights

See [optimisation](#optimisation) for more information.

##### Estimating the forecast diversification multiplier

See [estimating diversification multipliers](#divmult).

<a name="buffer"> </a>

#### Buffering and position inertia

Position inertia, or buffering, is a way of reducing trading costs. The idea is
that we avoid trading if our optimal position changes only slightly by applying
a 'no trade' buffer around the current position. There is more on this subject
in chapter 11 of my book.

There are two methods that I use. *Position* buffering is the same as the
position inertia method used in my book. We compare the current position to the
optimal position. If it's not within 10% (the 'buffer') then we trade to the
optimal position, otherwise we don't bother.

This configuration will implement position inertia as in my book.

YAML:
```
buffer_trade_to_edge: False
buffer_method: position
buffer_size: 0.10
```

The second method is *forecast* buffering. Here we take a proportion of the
average absolute position (what we get with a forecast of 10), and use that to
size the buffer width. This is more theoretically correct; since the buffer
doesn't shrink as we get to zero. Secondly if outside the buffer we trade to
the nearest edge of the buffer, rather than going to the optimal position. This
further reduces transaction costs. Here are my recommended settings for
forecast buffering:

YAML:
```
buffer_trade_to_edge: True
buffer_method: forecast
buffer_size: 0.10
```

Note that buffering can work on both rounded and unrounded positions. In the
case of rounded positions we round the lower limit of the buffer, and the upper
limit.

These python methods allow you to see buffering in action.

```
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("US10") ## get the position before buffering
system.portfolio.get_buffers_for_position("US10") ## get the upper and lower edges of the buffer
system.accounts.get_buffered_position("US10", roundpositions=True) ## get the buffered position.
```

Note that in a live trading system buffering is done downstream of the
system module, in a process which can also see the actual current positions we
hold [the strategy order generation)](/production.md).

Finally, if you set buffer_method to none there will be no buffering.

#### Capital correction

If you want to see positions that reflect varying capital, then read the
section on [capital correction](#capcorrection).


<a name="accounts_stage"> </a>

### Stage: Accounting

The final stage is the all important accounting stage, which calculates p&l.

<a name="standard_accounts_stage"> </a>

#### Using the standard [Account class](/systems/accounts/accounts_stage.py)

The standard accounting class includes several useful methods:

- `portfolio`: works out the p&l for the whole system (returns accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_instrument`: the contribution of a particular instrument to the
  p&l (returns accountCurve)
- `pandl_for_subsystem`: work out how an instrument has done in isolation
  (returns accountCurve)
- `pandl_across_subsystems`: group together all subsystem p&l (not the same as
  portfolio! Instrument weights aren't used) (returns accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_trading_rule`: how a trading rule has done aggregated over all
  instruments (returns accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted`: how a trading rule has done over all
  instruments as a proportion of total capital (returns accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted`: how a trading rule has done over all
  instruments, unweighted (returns accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_all_trading_rules`: how all trading rules have done over all
  instruments (returns nested accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted`: how all trading rules have done
  over all instruments, unweighted (returns nested accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_instrument_rules`: how all trading rules have done for a
  particular instrument (returns accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted`: how all trading rules have done for
  one instrument, unweighted (returns accountCurveGroup)
- `pandl_for_instrument_forecast`: work out how well a particular trading rule
  variation has done with a particular instrument (returns accountCurve)
- `pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted`: work out how well a particular
  trading rule variation has done with a particular instrument as a proportion
  of total capital (returns accountCurve)


(Note that [buffered](#buffer) positions are only used at the final portfolio
stage; the positions for forecasts and subsystems are not buffered. So their
trading costs may be a little overstated).

(Warning: see [weighted and unweighted account curve groups](#weighted_acg) )

Most of these classes share some useful arguments (all boolean):

- `delayfill`: Assume we trade at the next days closing price. Always defaults
  to True (more conservative)
- `roundpositions`: Round positions to nearest instrument block. Defaults to
  True for portfolios and instruments, defaults to False for subsystems. Not
  used in `pandl_for_instrument_forecast` or `pandl_for_trading_rule` (always
  False)

All p&l methods return an object of type `accountCurve` (for instruments,
subsystems and instrument forecasts) or `accountCurveGroup` (for portfolio and
trading rule), or even nested `accountCurveGroup`
(`pandl_for_all_trading_rules`, `pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted`). This
inherits from a pandas data frame, so it can be plotted, averaged and so on. It
also has some special methods. To see what they are use the `stats` method:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.accounts.portfolio().stats()
```

```
[[('min', '-1.997e+05'),
  ('max', '4.083e+04'),
  ('median', '-1.631'),
  ('mean', '156.9'),
  ('std', '5226'),
  ('skew', '-7.054'),
  ('ann_mean', '4.016e+04'),
  ('ann_std', '8.361e+04'),
  ('sharpe', '0.4803'),
  ('sortino', '0.5193'),
  ('avg_drawdown', '-1.017e+05'),
  ('time_in_drawdown', '0.9621'),
  ('calmar', '0.1199'),
  ('avg_return_to_drawdown', '0.395'),
  ('avg_loss', '-3016'),
  ('avg_gain', '3371'),
  ('gaintolossratio', '1.118'),
  ('profitfactor', '1.103'),
  ('hitrate', '0.4968'),
  ('t_stat', '2.852'),
  ('p_value', '0.004349')],
 ('You can also plot / print:',
  ['rolling_ann_std', 'drawdown', 'curve', 'percent'])]
```

The `stats` method lists three kinds of output:

1. Statistics which can also be extracted with their own methods eg to extract
   sortino use `system.accounts.portfolio().sortino()`
2. Methods which can be used to do interesting plots eg
   `system.accounts.portfolio().drawdown()`
3. Attributes which can be used to get returns over different periods, eg
   `systems.accounts.portfolio().annual`


#### `accountCurve`

There is a lot more to `accountCurve` and group objects than meets the eye.

Let's start with `accountCurve`, which is the output you get from
`systems.account.pandl_for_subsystem` amongst other things

```python
acc_curve=system.accounts.pandl_for_subsystem("EDOLLAR")
```

This *looks* like a pandas data frame, where each day is a different return.
However it's actually a bit more interesting than that. There's actually three
different account curves buried inside this; *gross* p&l without costs,
*costs*, and *net* including costs. We can access any of them like so:

```python
acc_curve.gross
acc_curve.net
acc_curve.costs
acc_curve.to_ncg_frame() ## this method returns a data frame with all 3 elements as columns
```

The *net* version is identical to acc_curve; this is deliberate to encourage
you to look at net returns. Each curve defaults to displaying daily returns,
however we can also access different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly,
annual):

```python
acc_curve.gross.daily ## equivalent to acc_curve.gross
acc_curve.net.daily ## equivalent to acc_curve and acc_curve.net
acc_curve.net.weekly ## or also acc_curve.weekly
acc_curve.costs.monthly
```

Once you have the frequency you require you can then use any of the statistical
methods:

```python
acc_curve.gross.daily.stats() ## Get a list of methods. equivalent to acc_curve.gross.stats()
acc_curve.annual.sharpe() ## Sharpe ratio based on annual
acc_curve.gross.weekly.std() ## standard deviation of weekly returns
acc_curve.daily.ann_std() ## annualised std. deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve.costs.annual.median() ## median of annual costs

```

... or other interesting methods:

```python
import syscore.pandas.strategy_functions

acc_curve.rolling_ann_std()  ## rolling annual standard deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve.gross.curve()  ## cumulated returns = account curve of gross daily returns
syscore.pandas.strategy_functions.drawdown()  ## drawdown of monthly net returns
acc_curve.costs.weekly.curve()  ## cumulated weekly costs
```

Personally I prefer looking at statistics in percentage terms. This is easy.
Just use the .percent property before you use any statistical method:

```python
import syscore.pandas.strategy_functions

acc_curve.capital  ## tells me the capital I will use to calculate %
acc_curve.percent
acc_curve.gross.daily.percent
acc_curve.net.daily.percent
acc_curve.costs.monthly.percent
acc_curve.gross.daily.percent.stats()
acc_curve.monthly.percent.sharpe()
acc_curve.gross.weekly.percent.std()
acc_curve.daily.percent.ann_std()
acc_curve.costs.annual.percent.median()
acc_curve.percent.rolling_ann_std()
acc_curve.gross.percent.curve()
syscore.pandas.strategy_functions.drawdown()
acc_curve.costs.weekly.percent.curve()
```

Incidentally you can 'daisy-chain' the percentage, frequency, and gross/net/costs operators in any order; the underlying object isn't actually changed, it's just the representation of it that is modified. If you want to reverse a percentage operator you can use .value_terms().


#### `accountCurveGroup` in more detail

`accountCurveGroup`, is the output you get from `systems.account.portfolio`,
`systems.account.pandl_across_subsystems`,
`pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted`, `pandl_for_trading_rule` and
`pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted`. For example:

```python
acc_curve_group=system.accounts.portfolio()
```

Again this *looks* like a pandas data frame, or indeed like an ordinary account
curve object. So for example these all work:

```python
acc_curve_group.gross.daily.stats() ## Get a list of methods. equivalent to acc_curve.gross.stats()
acc_curve_group.annual.sharpe() ## Sharpe ratio based on annual
acc_curve_group.gross.weekly.std() ## standard deviation of weekly returns
acc_curve_group.daily.ann_std() ## annualised std. deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve_group.costs.annual.median() ## median of annual costs

```

These are in fact all giving the p&l for the entire portfolio (the sum of
individual account curves across all assets); defaulting to giving the net,
daily curve. To find out which assets we use acc_curve_group.asset_columns; to
access a particular asset we use `acc_curve_group['assetName']`.

```python
acc_curve_group.asset_columns
acc_curve_group['US10']
```

*Warning see [weighted and unweighted account curve groups](#weighted_acg)*

The second command returns the account curves *just* for US 10 year bonds. So
we can do things like:

```python
acc_curve_group['US10'].gross.daily.stats() ## Get a list of methods. equivalent to acc_curve.gross.stats()
acc_curve_group['US10'].annual.sharpe() ## Sharpe ratio based on annual
acc_curve_group['US10'].gross.weekly.std() ## standard deviation of weekly returns
acc_curve_group['US10'].daily.ann_std() ## annualised std. deviation of daily (net) returns
acc_curve_group['US10'].costs.annual.median() ## median of annual costs

acc_curve_group.gross['US10'].weekly.std() ## notice equivalent way of getting account curves
```

Sometimes it's nicer to plot all the individual account curves, so we can get a
data frame.


```python
acc_curve_group.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
acc_curve_group.net.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
acc_curve_group.gross.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
acc_curve_group.costs.to_frame() ## returns net account curves all assets in a frame
```
*Warning see [weighted and unweighted account curve groups](#weighted_acg)*


The other thing you can do is get a dictionary of any statistical method,
measured across all assets:

```python
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe", "net", "daily") ## get all annualised sharpe ratios using daily data
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe", freq="daily") ## equivalent
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe", curve_type="net") ## equivalent
acc_curve_group.net.get_stats("sharpe", freq="daily") ## equivalent
acc_curve_group.net.get_stats("sharpe", percent=False) ## defaults to giving stats in % terms, this turns it off

```

*Warning see [weighted and unweighted account curve groups](#weighted_acg)*

You can get summary statistics for these. These can either be simple averages
across all assets, or time weighted by the amount of data each asset has.

```python
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").mean() ## get simple average of annualised sharpe ratios for net returns using daily data
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").std(timeweighted=True) ## get time weighted standard deviation of sharpes across assets,
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").tstat(timeweighted=False) ## t tstatistic for average sharpe ratio
acc_curve_group.get_stats("sharpe").pvalue(timeweighted=True) ## p value of t statistic of time weighted average sharpe ratio.

```



#### A nested `accountCurveGroup`

A nested `accountCurveGroup`, is the output you get from
`pandl_for_all_trading_rules` and `pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted`. For
example:

```python
nested_acc_curve_group=system.accounts.pandl_for_all_trading_rules()
```

This is an account curve group, whose elements are the performance of each
trading rule eg this kind of thing works:

```python
ewmac64_acc=system.accounts.pandl_for_all_trading_rules()['ewmac64_256']
```

However this is also an accountCurveGroup! So you can, for example display how
each instrument within this trading rule contributed to performance as a data
frame:

```python
ewmac64_acc.to_frame()
```

##### Weighted and unweighted account curve groups

There are two types of account curve; weighted and unweighted. Weighted curves
include returns for each instrument (or trading rule) as a proportion of the
total capital at risk. Unweighted curves show each instrument or trading rule
in isolation.

Weighted:
- `portfolio`: works out the p&l for the whole system (weighted group -
  elements are `pandl_for_instrument` - effective weights are instrument
  weights * IDM)
- `pandl_for_instrument`: the contribution of a particular instrument to the
p&l (weighted individual curve for one instrument - effective weight is
instrument weight * IDM) -`pandl_for_instrument_rules`: how all trading rules
have done for a particular instrument (weighted group - elements are
`pandl_for_instrument_forecast` across trading rules; effective weights are
forecast weights * FDM)
- `pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted`: work out how well a particular
  trading rule variation has done with a particular instrument as a proportion
  of total capital (weighted individual curve - weights are forecast weight *
  FDM * instrument weight * IDM)
- `pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted`: how a trading rule has done over all
  instruments as a proportion of total capital (weighted group -elements are
  `pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted` across instruments - effective
  weights are risk contribution of instrument to trading rule)
- `pandl_for_all_trading_rules`: how all trading rules have done over all
  instruments (weighted group -elements are `pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted`
  across variations - effective weight is risk contribution of each trading
  rule)

Partially weighted (see below):
- `pandl_for_trading_rule`: how a trading rule has done over all instruments
  (weighted group -elements are `pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted` across
  instruments, weights are risk contribution of each instrument to trading
  rule)

Unweighted:
- `pandl_across_subsystems`: works out the p&l for all subsystems (unweighted
  group - elements are `pandl_for_subsystem`)
- `pandl_for_subsystem`: work out how an instrument has done in isolation
  (unweighted individual curve for one instrument)
- `pandl_for_instrument_forecast`: work out how well a particular trading rule
  variation has done with a particular instrument (unweighted individual curve)
- `pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted`: how all trading rules have done for
  a particular instrument (unweighted group - elements are
  `pandl_for_instrument_forecast` across trading rules)
- `pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted`: how a trading rule has done over all
instruments (unweighted group -elements are `pandl_for_instrument_forecast`
across instruments)
- `pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted`: how all trading rules have done
  over all instruments (unweighted group -elements are `pandl_for_trading_rule`
  across instruments - effective weight is risk contribution of each trading
  rule)


Note that `pandl_across_subsystems` / `pandl_for_subsystem` are effectively the
unweighted versions of `portfolio` / `pandl_for_instrument`.

The difference is important for a few reasons.

- Firstly the return and risk of individual weighted curves will be lower than
  the target
- The returns of individual weighted curves will also be highly non stationary,
  at least for instruments. This is because the weightings of instruments
  within a portfolio, or a trading rule, will change over time. Usually there
  are fewer instruments. This means that the risk profile will show much higher
  returns earlier in the series. Statistics such as sharpe ratio may be highly
  misleading.
- The portfolio level aggregate returns of unweighted group curves will make no
  sense. They will be equally weighted, whereas we'd normally have different
  weights.
- Also for portfolios of unweighted groups risk will usually fall over time as
  markets are added and diversification effects appear. Again this is more
  problematic for groups of instruments (within a portfolio, or within a
  trading rule)

Weighting for trading rules p&l is a *little* complicated.

*`pandl_for_instrument_forecast`:* If I want the p&l of a single trading rule
for one instrument in isolation, then I use `pandl_for_instrument_forecast`.

*`pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted`*: If I aggregate these across instruments
then I get `pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted`. The individual unweighted
curves are instrument p&l for each instrument and forecast.

*`pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted`:* The weighted p&l of a single
trading rule for one instrument, as a proportion of the *entire system's
capital*, will be it's individual p&l in isolation
(`pandl_for_instrument_forecast`) multiplied by the product of the instrument
and forecast weights, and the IDM and FDM (this ignores the effect of total
forecast capping and position buffering or inertia).

*`pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted`:* The weighted p&l of a single trading rule
across individual instruments, as a proportion of the *entire system's
capital*, will be the group of `pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted` of
these for a given rule. You can get this with
`pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted`. The individual curves within this will be
instrument p&l for the relevant trading rule, effectively weighted by the
product of instrument, forecast weights, FDM and IDM. The risk of the total
curve will be equal to the risk of the rule as part of the total capital, so
will be lower than you'd expect.

*`pandl_for_all_trading_rules`:* If I group the resulting curves across trading
rules, then I get `pandl_for_all_trading_rules`. The individual curves will be
individual trading rules, weighted by their contribution to total risk. The
total curve is the entire system; it will look close to but not exactly like a
`portfolio` account curve because of the non linear effects of combined
forecast capping, and position buffering or inertia, and rounding if that's
used for the portfolio curve.

*`pandl_for_trading_rule`:* If I want the performance of a given trading rule
across individual instruments in isolation, then I need to take
`pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted` and normalise it so that the returns are as a
proportion of the sum of all the relevant forecast weight * FDM * instrument
weight * IDM; this is equivalent to the rules risk contribution within the
system. . This is an unweighted curve in one sense (it's not a proportion of
total capital), but it's weighted in another (the individual curves when added
up give the group curve). The total account curve will have the same target
risk as the entire system. The individual curves within it are for each
instrument, weighted by their contribution to risk.

*`pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted`:* If I group *these* curves together,
then I get `pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted`. The individual curves will
be individual trading rules but not weighted; so each will have its own risk
target. This is an unweighted group in the truest sense; the total curve won't
make sense.


To summarise:

- Individual account curves either in, or outside, a weighted group should be
  treated with caution. But the entire portfolio curve is fine.
- The portfolio level account curve for an unweighted group should be treated
  with caution. But the individual curves are fine.
- With the exception of `pandl_for_trading_rule` the portfolio level curve for
  a weighted group is a proportion of the entire system capital.

The attribute `weighted` is set to either True (for weighted curves
including `pandl_for_trading_rule`) or False (otherwise). All curve __repr__
methods also show either weighted or unweighted status.

#### Testing account curves

If you want to know how significant the returns for an account curve are (no
matter where you got it from), then use the method `accurve.t_test()`. This
returns the two sided t-test statistic and p-value for a null hypothesis of a
zero mean.

Sometimes you might want to compare the performance of two systems, instruments
or trading rules. The function `from syscore.accounting import account_t_test`
can be used for this purpose. The two parameters can be anything that looks
like an account curve, no matter where you got it from.

When run it returns a two sided t-test statistic and p-value for the null
hypothesis of identical means. This is done on the period of time that both
objects are trading.

Warning: The assumptions underlying a t-test may be violated for financial
data. Use with care.

<a name="costs"> </a>

#### Costs

I work out costs in two different ways:

- by applying a constant drag calculated according to the standardised cost in
  Sharpe ratio terms and the estimated turnover (see chapter 12 of my book)
- using the actual costs for each trade. 

The former method is always used for costs derived from forecasts
(`pandl_for_instrument_forecast`, `pandl_for_instrument_forecast_weighted`,
`pandl_for_trading_rule`, `pandl_for_all_trading_rules`,
`pandl_for_all_trading_rules_unweighted`, `pandl_for_trading_rule_unweighted`,
`pandl_for_trading_rule_weighted`, `pandl_for_instrument_rules_unweighted`, and
`pandl_for_instrument_rules`).

For costs derived from actual positions (everything else) we can use either method. Actual cash costs are more accurate especially if your system has sparse positions (eg the dynamic optimised system I describe elsewhere). However it's quicker to use SR costs, so if you set `use_SR_costs=True` you will speed things up with some loss of accuracy.

Both cost methods now account for holding - rollover costs.

Note that 'actual costs' are normally standardised for historic volatility (although you can optionally turn this off in config `vol_normalise_currency_costs=False` which is useful for comparing with live trading purposes, but I do not recommend it for historical purposes as I don't think it is accurate in the past)

Costs that can be included are:

- Slippage, in price points. Half the bid-ask spread, unless trading in large
  size or with a long history of trading at a better cost.
- Cost per instrument block, in local currency. This is used for most futures.
- Percentage of value costs (0.01 is 1%). Used for US equities.
- Per trade costs, in local currency. Common for UK brokers. This won't be
  applied correctly unless `roundpositions=True` in the accounts call.

To see the turnover that has been estimated use:

```
system.accounts.turnover_at_portfolio_level() ## Total portfolio turnover
system.accounts.subsystem_turnover(instrument_code) ### Annualised turnover of subsystem
system.accounts.instrument_turnover(instrument_code) ### Annualised turnover of portfolio level position
system.accounts.forecast_turnover(instrument_code, rule_variation_name) ## Annualised turnover of forecast
```

Instrument level turnovers are accurate for the vanilla system but may be misleading for systems with sparse positions (eg the dynamic optimised system I describe elsewhere) because the notion of 'average position' is difficult to quantify. 

To see holding costs in SR units:


```
system.accounts.get_rolls_per_year("EDOLLAR") ## four
system.accounts.get_SR_cost_per_trade_for_instrument("EDOLLAR") ## about 1 SR unit
system.accounts.get_SR_holding_cost_only("EDOLLAR") ## cost of 4 rolls per year: which is two 'turnovers'
system.accounts.get_SR_trading_cost_only_given_turnover("EDOLLAR", 5.0) ## trading five times a year, no holding cost
system.accounts.get_SR_cost_given_turnover("EDOLLAR", 5) ## includes both holding and trading costs for a turnover of 5
system.accounts.get_SR_cost_for_instrument_forecast("EDOLLAR", "carry") ## includes both
system.accounts.pandl_for_subsystem("EDOLLAR") ## includes both, assuming you're using SR costs
```



For calculating forecast costs (`pandl_for_instrument_forecast`... and so on.
Note these are used for estimating forecast weights) I offer the option to pool
costs across instruments. You can either pool the estimate of turnovers (which
I recommend), or pool the average of cost * turnover (which I don't recommend).
Averaging in the pooling process is always done with more weight given to
instruments that have more history.

```
forecast_cost_estimate:
   use_pooled_costs: False
   use_pooled_turnover: True
```

# Processes

This section gives much more detail on certain important processes that span
multiple stages: logging, estimating correlations and diversification
multipliers, optimisation, and capital correction.

<a name="filenames"> </a>

## File names

There are a number of different ways one might want to specify path and file names. Firstly, we could use a *relative* pathname. Secondly, we might want to use an *absolute* path, which is the actual full pathname. This is useful if we want to access something outside the pysystemtrade directory structure. Finally we have the issue of OS differences; are you a '\\' or a '/' person?

For convenience I have written some functions that translate between these different formats, and the underlying OS representation.

```python
from syscore.fileutils import get_resolved_pathname, resolve_path_and_filename_for_package

# Resolve both filename and pathname jointly. Useful when writing the name of eg a configuration file
## Absolute format
### Windows (note use of double backslash in str) Make sure you include the initial backslash, or will be treated as relative format
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("\\home\\rob\\file.csv")

### Unix. Make sure you include the initial forward slash,
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("/home/rob/file.csv")

## Relative format to find a file in the installed pysystemtrade
### Dot format. Notice there is no initial 'dot' and we don't need to include 'pysystemtrade'
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("syscore.tests.pricedata.csv")

# Specify the path and filename separately
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("\\home\\rob", "file.csv")
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("/home/rob", "file.csv")
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("syscore.tests", "pricedata.csv")

# Resolve just the pathname
get_resolved_pathname("/home/rob")
get_resolved_pathname("\\home\\rob")
get_resolved_pathname("syscore.tests")

## DON'T USE THESE:-
### It's possible to use Unix or Windows for relative filenames, but I prefer not to, so there is a clearer disctinction between absolute and relative.
### However this works:
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("syscore/tests/pricedata.csv")

### Similarly, I prefer not to use dot format for absolute filenames but it will work
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package(".home.rob.file.csv")

### Finally, You can mix and match the above formats in a single string, but it won't make the code very readable!
resolve_path_and_filename_for_package("\\home/rob.file.csv")

```


These functions are used internally whenever a file name is passed in, so feel free to use any of these file formats when specifying eg a configuration filename.
```
### Absolute: Windows (note use of double backslash in str)
"\\home\\rob\\file.csv"

### Absolute: Unix.
"/home/rob/file.csv"

## Relative: Dot format to find a file in the installed pysystemtrade
"syscore.tests.pricedata.csv"
```

<a name="logging"> </a>

## Logging

### Basic logging

pysystemtrade uses the [Python logging module](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/logging.html). The system, data, config and each stage object all have a .log attribute, to allow the system to report to the user; as do the functions provided to estimate correlations and do optimisations.

By default, log messages will print out to the console (`std.out`) at level DEBUG. This what you get in sim. This is configured by function `_configure_sim()` in `syslogging.logger.py`.

If you want to change the level, or the format of the messages, then create an environment variable that points to an alternative YAML logging configuration. Something like this for Bash

```
PYSYS_LOGGING_CONFIG=/home/path/to/your/logging_config.yaml
```

It could be a file within the project, so will accept the relative dotted path format. There's an example YAML file that replicates the default sim configuration

```
PYSYS_LOGGING_CONFIG=syslogging.logging_sim.yaml
```

If you're writing your own code, and want to inform the user that something is happening you should do one of the following:

```python
## self could be a system, stage, config or data object
#
self.log.debug("this is a message at level logging.DEBUG")
self.log.info("this is a message at level logging.INFO")
self.log.warning("level logging.WARNING")
self.log.error("level logging.ERROR")
self.log.critical("level logging.CRITICAL")

# parameterise the message
log.info("Hello %s", "world")
log.info("Goodbye %s %s", "cruel", "world")
```

I strongly encourage the use of logging, rather than printing, since printing on a 'headless' automated trading server will not be visible


### Advanced logging

In my experience wading through long log files is a rather time-consuming experience. On the other hand it's often more useful to use a logging approach to monitor system behaviour than to try and create quantitative diagnostics. For this reason I'm a big fan of logging with *attributes*. This project uses a custom version of [logging.LoggerAdapter](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/logging.html#loggeradapter-objects) for that purpose:

```python
from syslogging.logger import *

# setting attributes on logger initialisation
log = get_logger("logger name", {"stage": "first"})

# setting attributes on message creation
log.info("logger name", instrument_code="GOLD")
```

A logger is initialised with a name; should be the name of the top level calling function. Production types include price collection, execution and so on. Every time a log method is called, it will typically know one or more of the following:

- stage: Used by stages in System objects, such as 'rawdata'
- component: other parts of the top level function that have their own loggers
- currency_code: Currency code (used for fx), format 'GBPUSD'
- instrument_code: Self explanatory
- contract_date: Self explanatory, format 'yyyymm'
- broker: broker name
- clientid: IB unique identification
- strategy_name: self explanatory
- order_id: Self explanatory, used for live trading
- instrument_order_id: Self explanatory, used for live trading
- contract_order_id: Self explanatory, used for live trading
- broker_order_id: Self explanatory, used for live trading

You do need to keep track of what attributes your logger has. Generally speaking you should use this kind of pattern to write a log item

```python
# this is from the ForecastScaleCap code
#
# This log will already have type=base_system, and stage=forecastScaleCap
#
self.log.debug("Calculating scaled forecast for %s %s" % (instrument_code, rule_variation_name),
    instrument_code=instrument_code, rule_variation_name=rule_variation_name
)
```
This has the advantage of keeping the original log attributes intact. If you want to do something more complex it's worth looking at the docstring for [`syslogging.get_logger()`](/syslogging/logger.py) which shows usage patterns, including how to merge attributes.


<a name="optimisation"> </a>

## Optimisation

See my blog posts on optimisation:
[without](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/01/correlations-weights-multipliers.html)
and [with
costs](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html).

I use an optimiser to calculate both forecast and instrument weights. The
process is almost identical for both.

### The optimisation function, and data

From the config
```
forecast_weight_estimate: ## can also be applied to instrument weights
   func: sysquant.optimisation.generic_optimiser.genericOptimiser ## this is the only function provided
   pool_instruments: True ## not used for instrument weights
   frequency: "W" ## other options: D, M, Y

```

I recommend using weekly data, since it speeds things up and doesn't affect out
of sample performance.

### Removing expensive assets (forecast weights only)

Again I recommend you check out this [blog
post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html).

```
forecast_weight_estimate:
   ceiling_cost_SR: 0.13 ## Max cost to allow for assets, annual SR units.
    
```

See ['costs'](#costs) to see how to configure pooling when estimating the costs
of forecasts.

By default this is set to 9999 which effectively means that all trading rules are included at the optimisation stage. However the use of `post_ceiling_cost_SR` can be used to remove rules that are too expensive. This is recommended if you are pooling gross returns.


### Pooling gross returns (forecast weights only)

Pooling across instruments is only available when calculating forecast weights.
Again I recommend you check out this [blog
post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html).
Only instruments whose rules have survived the application of a ceiling cost (`ceiling_cost_SR`)
will be included in the pooling process. If you want to pool all instruments, regardless of costs, then you should set `ceiling_cost_SR` to be some high number, and use `post_ceiling_cost_SR` instead to eliminate expensive rules after the optimisation is complete (this is the default).


```
forecast_weight_estimate:
   pool_gross_returns: True ## pool gross returns for estimation
forecast_cost_estimate:
   use_pooled_costs: False  ### use weighted average of [SR cost * turnover] across instruments with the same set of trading rules
   use_pooled_turnover: True ### Use weighted average of turnover across instruments with the same set of trading rules
```

See ['costs'](#costs) to see how to configure pooling when estimating the costs
of forecasts. 



### Working out net costs (both instrument and forecast weights)

Again I recommend you check out this [blog post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html).

```
forecast_weight_estimate:  ## can also be applied to instrument weights
   equalise_gross: False ## equalise gross returns so that only costs are used for optimisation
   cost_multiplier: 0.0 ## multiply costs by this number. Zero means gross returns used. Higher than 1 means costs will be inflated. Use zero if apply_cost_weight=True (see later)
```


### Time periods


There are three options available for the fitting period - `expanding`
(recommended), `in sample` (never!) and `rolling`. See Chapter 3 of my book.

From the config
```
   date_method: expanding ## other options: in_sample, rolling
   rollyears: 20 ## only used when rolling
```

### Moment estimation

To do an optimisation we need estimates of correlations, means, and standard
deviations.

From the config

```
forecast_weight_estimate:  ## can also be applied to instrument weights
   correlation_estimate:
     func: sysquant.estimators.correlation_estimator.correlationEstimator
     using_exponent: False
     ew_lookback: 500
     min_periods: 20
     floor_at_zero: True

   mean_estimate:
     func: sysquant.estimators.mean_estimator.meanEstimator
     using_exponent: False
     ew_lookback: 500
     min_periods: 20

   vol_estimate:
     func: sysquant.estimators.stdev_estimator.stdevEstimator
     using_exponent: False
     ew_lookback: 500
     min_periods: 20
```

If you're using shrinkage or single period optimisation I'd suggest using an
exponential weight for correlations, means, and volatility.

### Methods

There are five methods provided to optimise with in the function I've included.
Personally I'd use handcrafting, which is the default.

#### Equal weights

This will give everything in the optimisation equal weights.

```
   method: equal_weights
```



Tip: Set `date_method: in_sample` to speed things up.


#### One period (not recommend)

This is the classic Markowitz optimisation with the option to equalise Sharpe
Ratios (makes things more stable) and volatilities. Since we're dealing with
things that should have the same volatility anyway the latter is something I
recommend doing.

```
   method: one_period
   equalise_SR: True
   ann_target_SR: 0.5  ## Sharpe we head to if we're equalising
   equalise_vols: True
```

Notice that if you equalise Sharpe then this will override the effect of any
pooling or changes to cost calculation.

#### Bootstrapping (recommended, but slow)

Bootstrapping is no longer implemented; after a code refactoring I couldn't think of an elegant way of doing it.

#### Shrinkage (okay, but tricky to calibrate)

This is a basic shrinkage towards a prior of equal sharpe ratios, and equal
correlations; with priors equal to the average of estimates from the data.
Shrinkage of 1.0 means we use the priors, 0.0 means we use the empirical
estimates.

```
   method: shrinkage
   shrinkage_SR: 0.90
   ann_target_SR: 0.5  ## Sharpe we head to if we're shrinking
   shrinkage_corr: 0.50
   equalise_vols: True

```

Notice that if you equalise Sharpe by shrinking with a factor of 1.0, then this
will override the effect of any pooling or changes to cost calculation.


#### Handcrafting (recommended)

### Post processing

If we haven't accounted for costs earlier (eg by setting `cost_multiplier=0`)
then we can adjust our portfolio weights according to costs after they've been
calculated. See this blog post [blog
post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/05/optimising-weights-with-costs.html).

If weights are *cleaned*, then in a fitting period when we need a weight, but
none has been calculated (due to insufficient data for example), an instrument
is given a share of the weight.


```
   apply_cost_weight: False
   cleaning: True

```

At this stage the other cost ceiling will be applied (`config.post_ceiling_cost_SR`).

## Estimating correlations and diversification multipliers

See [my blog
post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/01/correlations-weights-multipliers.html)


You can estimate diversification multipliers for both instruments (IDM - see
chapter 11) and forecasts (FDM - see chapter 8).

The first step is to estimate *correlations*. The process is the same, except
that for forecasts you have the option to pool instruments together. As the
following YAML extract shows I recommend estimating these with an exponential
moving average on weekly data:

```
forecast_correlation_estimate:
   pool_instruments: True ## not available for IDM estimation
   func:sysquant.estimators.pooled_correlation.pooled_correlation_estimator ## function to use for estimation. This handles both pooled and non pooled data
   frequency: "W"   # frequency to downsample to before estimating correlations
   date_method: "expanding" # what kind of window to use in backtest
   using_exponent: True  # use an exponentially weighted correlation, or all the values equally
   ew_lookback: 250 ## lookback when using exponential weighting
   min_periods: 20  # min_periods, used for both exponential, and non exponential weighting
   cleaning: True  # Replace missing values with an average so we don't lose data early on
   floor_at_zero: True
   forward_fill_data: True

instrument_correlation_estimate:
   func: sysquant.estimators.correlation_over_time.correlation_over_time_for_returns # these aren't pooled'
   frequency: "W"
   date_method: "expanding"
   using_exponent: True
   ew_lookback: 250
   min_periods: 20
   cleaning: True
   rollyears: 20
   floor_at_zero: True
   forward_fill_price_index: True # we ffill prices not returns or goes wrong

```

Once we have correlations, and the forecast or instrument weights, it's a
trivial calculation.

```
instrument_div_mult_estimate:
   func: sysquant.estimators.diversification_multipliers.diversification_multiplier_from_list
   ewma_span: 125   ## smooth to apply, business day space
   div_mult: 2.5 ## maximum allowable multiplier
```

I've included a smoothing function, otherwise jumps in the multiplier will
cause trading in the backtest. Note that the FDM is calculated on an instrument
by instrument basis, but if instruments have had their forecast weights and
correlations estimated on a pooled basis they'll have the same FDM. It's also a
good idea to floor negative correlations at zero to avoid inflating the DM to
very high values.

## Capital correction: Varying capital

Capital correction is the process by which we change the capital we have at
risk, and thus our positions, according to any profits or losses made. Most of
pysystemtrade assumes that capital is *fixed*. This has the advantage that risk
is stable over time, and account curves can more easily be interpreted. However
a more common method is to use *compounded* capital, where profits are added to
capital and losses deducted. If we make money then our capital, and the risk
we're taking, and the size of our positions, will all increase over time.

There is much more in this [blog
post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/06/capital-correction-pysystemtrade.html).
Capital correction is controlled by the following config parameter which
selects the function used for correction using the normal dot argument (the
default here being the function `fixed_capital` in the module
`syscore.capital`)

YAML:
```
capital_multiplier:
   func: syscore.capital.fixed_capital
```

Other functions I've written are `full_compounding` and `half_compounding`.
Again see the blog post [blog
post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/06/capital-correction-pysystemtrade.html)
for more detail.

To get the varying capital multiplier which the chosen method calculates use
`system.accounts.capital_multiplier()`. The multiplier will be 1.0 at a given
time if the variable capital is identical to the fixed capital.

Here's a list of methods with their counterparts for both fixed and variable
capital:

|                             | Fixed capital | Variable capital |
|:-------------------------:|:---------:|:---------------:|
| Get capital at risk | `positionSize.get_daily_cash_vol_target()['notional_trading_capital']` | `accounts.get_actual_capital()` |
| Get position in a system portfolio | `portfolio.get_notional_position` | `portfolio.get_actual_position` |
| Get buffers for a position | `portfolio.get_buffers_for_position` | `portfolio.get_actual_buffers_for_position` |
| Get buffered position | `accounts.get_buffered_position`| `accounts.get_buffered_position_with_multiplier`|
| Get p&l for instrument at system level | `accounts.pandl_for_instrument`| `accounts.pandl_for_instrument_with_multiplier`|
| P&L for whole system | `accounts.portfolio`| `accounts.portfolio_with_multiplier`|

All other methods in pysystemtrade use fixed capital.

## Table of standard system.data and system.stage methods

The tables in this section list all the public methods that can be used to get data
out of a system and its 'child' stages. You can also use the methods() method:

```python
system.rawdata.methods() ## works for any stage or data
```

### Explanation of columns

For brevity the name of the system instance is omitted from the 'call' column
(except where it's the actual system object we're calling directly). So for
example to get the instrument price for Eurodollar from the data object, which
is marked as *`data.get_raw_price`* we would do something like this:

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
name_of_system=futures_system()
name_of_system.data.get_raw_price("EDOLLAR")
```

Standard methods are in all systems. Non standard methods are for stage classes
inherited from the standard class, eg the raw data method specific to
*futures*; or the *estimate* classes which estimate parameters rather than use
fixed versions.

Common arguments are:

- `instrument_code`: A string indicating the name of the instrument
- `rule_variation_name`: A string indicating the name of the trading rule
  variation

Types are one or more of D, I, O:

- **D**iagnostic: Exposed method useful for seeing intermediate calculations
- Key **I**nput: A method which gets information from another stage. See [stage
  wiring](#stage_wiring). The description will list the source of the data.
- Key **O**utput: A method whose output is used by other stages. See [stage
  wiring](#stage_wiring). Note this excludes items only used by specific
  trading rules (notably rawdata.daily_annualised_roll)

Private methods are excluded from this table.

<a name="Configuration_options"> </a>

## Configuration options

Below is a list of all configuration options for the system. The 'Yaml' section
shows how they appear in a yaml file. The 'python' section shows an example of
how you'd modify a config object in memory having first created it, like this:


```python
## Method one: from an existing system
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
new_config=system.config

## Method two: from a config file
from syscore.fileutils import get_pathname_for_package
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config

my_config=Config(get_pathname_for_package("private", "this_system_name", "config.yaml"))

## Method three: with a blank config
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
my_config=Config()
```

Each section also shows the project default options, which you could change
[here](#defaults).

When modifying a nested part of a config object, you can of course replace it
wholesale:

```python
new_config.instrument_weights=dict(SP500=0.5, US10=0.5))
new_config
```

Or just in part:

```python
new_config.instrument_weights['SP500']=0.2
new_config
```
If you do this make sure the rest of the config is consistent with what you've done. In either case, it's a good idea to examine the modified config once it's part of the system (since that will include any defaults) and make sure you're happy with it.



### Raw data stage

#### Volatility calculation
Represented as: dict of str, int, or float. Keywords: Parameter names Defaults:
As below

The function used to calculate volatility, and any keyword arguments passed to
it. Note if any keyword is missing then the project defaults will be used. See
['volatility calculation'](#vol_calc) for more information.

The following shows how to modify the configuration, and also the default
values:

YAML:
```
volatility_calculation:
  func: "sysquant.estimators.vol.robust_vol_calc"
  days: 35
  min_periods: 10
  vol_abs_min: 0.0000000001
  vol_floor: True
  floor_min_quant: 0.05
  floor_min_periods: 100
  floor_days: 500

```

Python
```python
config.volatility_calculation=dict(func="syscore.algos.robust.vol.calc", days=35, min_periods=10, vol_abs_min= 0.0000000001, vol_floor=True, floor_min_quant=0.05, floor_min_periods=100, floor_days=500)
```

If you're considering using your own function please see [configuring defaults
for your own functions](#config_function_defaults)


### Rules stage

#### Trading rules
Represented as: dict of dicts, each representing a trading rule. Keywords:
trading rule variation names. Defaults: n/a

The set of trading rules. A trading rule definition consists of a dict
containing: a *function* identifying string, an optional list of *data*
identifying strings, and *other_args* an optional dictionary containing named
parameters to be passed to the function. This is the only method that can be
used for YAML.

There are numerous other ways to define trading rules using python code. See
['Rules'](#rules) for more detail.

Note that *forecast_scalar* isn't strictly part of the trading rule definition,
but if included here will be used instead of the separate
'config.forecast_scalar' parameter (see the next section).

YAML: (example)
```
trading_rules:
  ewmac2_8:
     function: systems.futures.rules.ewmac
     data:
         - "rawdata.daily_prices"
         - "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"
     other_args:
         Lfast: 2
         Lslow: 8
     forecast_scalar: 10.6
```

Python (example)
```python
config.trading_rules=dict(ewmac2_8=dict(function="systems.futures.rules.ewmac", data=["rawdata.daily_prices", "rawdata.daily_returns_volatility"], other_args=dict(Lfast=2, Lslow=8), forecast_scalar=10.6))
```

### Forecast scaling and capping stage

Switch between fixed (default) and estimated versions as follows:

YAML: (example)
```
use_forecast_scale_estimates: True
```

Python (example)
```python
config.use_forecast_scale_estimates=True
```



#### Forecast scalar (fixed)
Represented as: dict of floats. Keywords: trading rule variation names.
Default: 1.0

The forecast scalar to apply to a trading rule, if fixed scaling is being used.
If undefined the default value of 1.0 will be used.

Scalars can also be put inside trading rule definitions (this is the first
place we look):

YAML: (example)
```
trading_rules:
  rule_name:
     function: systems.futures.rules.arbitrary_function
     forecast_scalar: 10.6

```

Python (example)
```python
config.trading_rules=dict(rule_name=dict(function="systems.futures.rules.arbitrary_function", forecast_scalar=10.6))
```

If scalars are not found there they can be put in separately (if you do both
then the scalar in the actual rule specification will take precedence):

YAML: (example)
```
forecast_scalars:
   rule_name: 10.6
```

Python (example)
```python
config.forecast_scalars=dict(rule_name=10.6)
```

#### Forecast scalar (estimated)
Represented as: dict of str, float and int. Keywords: parameter names Default:
see below

The method used to estimate forecast scalars on a rolling out of sample basis.
Any missing config elements are pulled from the project defaults. Compulsory
arguments are pool_instruments (determines if we pool estimate over multiple
instruments) and func (str function pointer to use for estimation). The
remaining arguments are passed to the estimation function.

See [forecast scale estimation](#scalar_estimate) for more detail.

If you're considering using your own function please see [configuring defaults
for your own functions](#config_function_defaults)


YAML:
```
# Here is how we do the estimation. These are also the *defaults*.
use_forecast_scale_estimates: True
forecast_scalar_estimate:
   pool_instruments: True
   func: "sysquant.estimators.forecast_scalar.forecast_scalar"
   window: 250000
   min_periods: 500
   backfill: True


```

Python (example)
```python
## pooled example
config.trading_rules=dict(pool_instruments=True, func="sysquant.estimators.forecast_scalar.forecast_scalar", window=250000, min_periods=500, backfill=True)
```


#### Forecast cap (fixed - all classes)
Represented as: float

The forecast cap to apply to a trading rule. If undefined the project default
value of 20.0 will be used.


YAML:
```
forecast_cap: 20.0
```

Python
```python
config.forecast_cap=20.0
```

### Forecast combination stage

Switch between fixed (default) and estimated versions as follows:

YAML: (example)
```
use_forecast_weight_estimates: True
```

Python (example)
```python
config.use_forecast_weight_estimates=True
```

Change smoothing used for both fixed and variable weights:

YAML: (example)
```
forecast_weight_ewma_span: 6
```

Remove trading rules which are too expensive for a given instrument:

YAML: (example)
```
post_ceiling_cost_SR: 0.13
```




#### Forecast weights (fixed)
Represented as: (a) dict of floats. Keywords: trading rule variation names. (b)
                dict of dicts, each representing the weights for an instrument.
                Keywords: instrument names Default: Equal weights, across all
                trading rules in the system

The forecast weights to be used to combine forecasts from different trading
rule variations. These can be (a) common across instruments, or (b) specified
differently for each instrument.

Notice that the default is equal weights, but these are calculated on the fly
and don't appear in the defaults file.

YAML: (a)
```
forecast_weights:
     ewmac: 0.50
     carry: 0.50

```

Python (a)
```python
config.forecast_weights=dict(ewmac=0.5, carry=0.5)
```

YAML: (b)
```
forecast_weights:
     SP500:
      ewmac: 0.50
      carry: 0.50
     US10:
      ewmac: 0.10
      carry: 0.90

```

Python (b)
```python
config.forecast_weights=dict(SP500=dict(ewmac=0.5, carry=0.5), US10=dict(ewmac=0.10, carry=0.90))
```
#### Forecast weights (estimated)

To estimate forecast weights we need to define which trading rule variations
we're using.

##### List of trading rules to get forecasts for

Represented as: (a) list of str, each a rule variation name (b) dict of list of
                str, each representing the rules for an instrument. Keywords:
                instrument names Default: Using all trading rules in the system

The rules for which forecast weights are to be calculated. These can be (a)
common across instruments, or (b) specified differently for each instrument. If
not specified will use all the rules defined in the system.

YAML: (a)
```
rule_variations:
     - "ewmac"
     - "carry"

```

Python (a)
```python
config.rule_variations=["ewmac", "carry"]
```

YAML: (b)
```
rule_variations:
     SP500:
      - "ewmac"
      - "carry"
     US10:
      - "ewmac"
```

Python (b)
```python
config.forecast_weights=dict(SP500=["ewmac","carry"], US10=["ewmac"])
```
##### Parameters for estimating forecast weights

See the section on [Optimisation](#optimisation)


#### Forecast diversification multiplier  (fixed)
Represented as: (a) float or (b) dict of floats with keywords: instrument_codes
Default: 1.0

This can be (a) common across instruments, or (b) we use a different one for
each instrument (would be normal if instrument weights were also different).


YAML: (a)
```
forecast_div_multiplier: 1.0

```

Python (a)
```python
config.forecast_div_multiplier=1.0
```

YAML: (b)
```
forecast_div_multiplier:
     SP500: 1.4
     US10:  1.1
```

Python (b)
```python
config.forecast_div_multiplier=dict(SP500=1.4, US10=1.0)
```


#### Forecast diversification multiplier  (estimated)

See the section on [estimating correlations and diversification multipliers](#estimating-correlations-and-diversification-multipliers)



##### Forecast mapping

Represented as: dict (key names instrument names) of dict (key names: a_param,b_param, threshold). Defaults: dict(a_param = 1.0, b_param = 1.0, threshold = 0.0) equivalent to no mapping



YAML, showing defaults
```
forecast_mapping:
  AUD:
    a_param: 1.0
    b_param: 1.0
    threshold: 0.0
# etc
```

Python, example of how to change certain parameters:

```python
config.forecast_mapping = dict()
config.forecast_maping['AUD'] = dict(a_param=1.0, b_param=1.0, threshold = 0.0)
config.forecast_maping['AUD']['a_param'] = 1.0
```



### Position sizing stage

#### Capital scaling parameters
Represented as: floats, int or str Defaults: See below

The annualised percentage volatility target, notional trading capital and
currency of trading capital. If any of these are undefined in the config the
default values shown below will be used.


YAML:
```
percentage_vol_target: 16.0
notional_trading_capital: 1000000
base_currency: "USD"
```

Python

```python
config.percentage_vol_target=16.0
config.notional_trading_capital=1000000
config.base_currency="USD"
```

### Portfolio combination stage

Switch between fixed (default) and estimated versions as follows:

YAML: (example)
```
use_instrument_weight_estimates: True
```

Python (example)
```python
config.use_instrument_weight_estimates=True
```

Change smoothing used for both fixed and variable weights:

YAML: (example)
```
instrument_weight_ewma_span: 125
```


#### Instrument weights (fixed)
Represented as: dict of floats. Keywords: instrument_codes Default: Equal
weights

The instrument weights used to combine different instruments together into the
final portfolio.

Although the default is equal weights, these are not included in the system
defaults file, but calculated on the fly.

YAML:
```
instrument_weights:
    EDOLLAR: 0.5
    US10: 0.5
```

Python
```python
config.instrument_weights=dict(EDOLLAR=0.5, US10=0.5)
```

#### Instrument weights (estimated)

See the section on [Optimisation](#optimisation)


#### Instrument diversification multiplier (fixed)
Represented as: float Default: 1.0


YAML:
```
instrument_div_multiplier: 1.0
```

Python
```python
config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.0
```

#### Instrument diversification multiplier (estimated)

See the section on [estimating correlations and diversification multipliers](#estimating-correlations-and-diversification-multipliers)


#### Buffering

Represented as: bool Default: see below

Which [buffering or position inertia method](#buffer) should we use?
'position': based on optimal position (position inertia), 'forecast': based on
position with a forecast of +10; or 'none': do not use a buffer. What size
should the buffer be, as a proportion of the position or average forecast
position? 0.1 is 10%.

YAML:
```
buffer_method: position
buffer_size: 0.10
```



### Accounting stage

#### Buffering and position inertia

To work out the portfolio positions should we trade to the edge of the
[buffer](#buffer), or to the optimal position?

Represented as: bool Default: True

YAML:
```
buffer_trade_to_edge: True
```



#### Costs

Should we use normalised Sharpe Ratio [costs](#costs), or the actual costs for
instrument level p&l (we always use SR costs for forecasts)?


YAML:
```

use_SR_costs: True
```

Should we pool SR costs across instruments when working out forecast p&L?

YAML:
```
forecast_cost_estimate:
   use_pooled_costs: False  ### use weighted average of SR cost * turnover across instruments with the same set of trading rules
   use_pooled_turnover: True ### Use weighted average of turnover across instruments with the same set of trading rules
```

#### Capital correction

Which capital correction method should we use?

YAML:
```
capital_multiplier:
   func: syscore.capital.fixed_capital
```

Other valid functions include full_compounding and half_compounding.
