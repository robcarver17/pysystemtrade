Here is a whistle-stop tour of what pysystemtrade can currently do. You'll probably want to read the [users guide](backtesting.md) after this.
Notice that you will see different results than shown here, as you will be using more up to date data.

## A simple trading rule

(code is [here](/examples/introduction/asimpletradingrule.py) )

As systematic traders we believe that the future will be at least a bit like the past. So first of all we need some past data. In principle past data can come from many places, but to begin with we'll get it from some pre-baked .csv files:

```python
from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData
data=csvFuturesSimData()
data
```

```
FuturesData object with 38 instruments
```

What instruments have we got?

```python
data.get_instrument_list()
```

```
['CORN', 'LEANHOG', 'LIVECOW', 'SOYBEAN', 'WHEAT', 'KR10', 'KR3', 'BOBL', 'BTP', 'BUND', 'OAT', 'SHATZ', 'US10', 'US2', 'US20', 'US5', 'V2X', 'VIX', 'KOSPI', 'AEX', 'CAC', 'SMI', 'NASDAQ', 'SP500', 'AUD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'JPY', 'MXP', 'NZD', 'COPPER', 'GOLD', 'PALLAD', 'PLAT', 'CRUDE_W', 'GAS_US', 'SOFR', 'EUROSTX']
```

Not all the instruments are easily identifiable

```
data.get_instrument_object_with_meta_data("MUMMY")
```

```
futuresInstrumentWithMetaData(instrument=MUMMY, meta_data=instrumentMetaData(Description='TSE Mothers Index', Pointsize=1000.0, Currency='JPY', AssetClass='Equity', Slippage=0.5, PerBlock=50.0, Percentage=0.0, PerTrade=0.0))
```

And what kind of data can we get for them?

```python
data.get_raw_price("SOFR").tail(5)
```

```
2016-05-05    98.6400
2016-05-06    98.6050
2016-05-09    98.6550
2016-05-10    98.6500
2016-05-11    98.6675
Name: price, dtype: float64
```

*I'll update the data regularly, as well as including methods for you to get your own data from different sources*

*Technical note: This is the 'back-adjusted' price for the future, formed from stitching adjacent contracts together using the 'panama' method*

`data` objects behave a bit like dicts (though they don't formally inherit from them). So these both work:

```python
data.keys() ## equivalent to data.get_instrument_list
data['SP500_micro'] ## equivalent to data.get_instrument_price
```

Price data is useful, but is there any other data available? For futures, yes, we can get the data we need to implement a carry rule:

```python
data.get_instrument_raw_carry_data("SOFR").tail(6)

```

```
              PRICE   CARRY CARRY_CONTRACT PRICE_CONTRACT
2016-05-04  98.5800  98.645         201903         201906
2016-05-05  98.6400  98.700         201903         201906
2016-05-06  98.6050  98.665         201903         201906
2016-05-09  98.6550  98.715         201903         201906
2016-05-10  98.6500  98.705         201903         201906
2016-05-11  98.6675     NaN         201903         201906
```

Let's create a simple trading rule.

```python

import pandas as pd
from sysquant.estimators.vol import robust_vol_calc


def calc_ewmac_forecast(price, Lfast, Lslow=None):
    """
    Calculate the ewmac trading rule forecast, given a price and EWMA speeds Lfast, Lslow and vol_lookback

    """
    ## price: This is the stitched price series
    ## We can't use the price of the contract we're trading, or the volatility will be jumpy
    ## And we'll miss out on the rolldown. See https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2015/05/systems-building-futures-rolling.html

    price = price.resample("1B").last()
    if Lslow is None:
        Lslow = 4 * Lfast

    ## We don't need to calculate the decay parameter, just use the span directly

    fast_ewma = price.ewm(span=Lfast).mean()
    slow_ewma = price.ewm(span=Lslow).mean()
    raw_ewmac = fast_ewma - slow_ewma

    vol = robust_vol_calc(price.diff())

    return raw_ewmac / vol

```
Let's run it and look at the output

```python
instrument_code='SOFR'
price=data.daily_prices(instrument_code)
ewmac=calc_ewmac_forecast(price, 32, 128)
ewmac.tail(5)

from matplotlib.pyplot import show
ewmac.plot()
show()
```

```

2016-05-06    4.649790

2016-05-10    4.896521
2016-05-11    5.083896
Freq: B, dtype: float64
```

Did we make any money?

```python
from systems.accounts.account_forecast import pandl_for_instrument_forecast
account = pandl_for_instrument_forecast(forecast = ewmac, price=price)
account.percent.stats()
```

```
[[('min', '-7.911'),
  ('max', '5.22'),
  ('median', '0'),
  ('mean', '0.01644'),
  ('std', '0.5173'),
  ('skew', '-0.5757'),
  ('ann_mean', '4.208'),
  ('ann_std', '8.276'),
  ('sharpe', '0.5084'),
  ('sortino', '0.569'),
  ('avg_drawdown', '-11.93'),

  ('calmar', '0.1269'),
  ('avg_return_to_drawdown', '0.3526'),
  ('avg_loss', '-0.3307'),
  ('avg_gain', '0.3418'),
  ('gaintolossratio', '1.034'),
  ('profitfactor', '1.12'),

  ('p_value', '0.003405')],
 ('You can also plot / print:',
  ['rolling_ann_std', 'drawdown', 'curve', 'percent'])]
```

Looks like we did make a few bucks. `account`, by the way inherits from a pandas data frame. Here are some other things we can do with it:

```python
import syscore.pandas.strategy_functions

account.sharpe()  ## get the Sharpe Ratio (annualised), and any other statistic which is in the stats list
account.curve().plot()  ## plot the cumulative account curve (equivalent to account.cumsum().plot() inicidentally)
account.percent  ## gives a % curve
syscore.pandas.strategy_functions.drawdown().plot()  ## see the drawdowns as a percentage
account.weekly  ## weekly returns (also daily [default], monthly, annual)
account.gross.ann_mean()  ## annual mean for gross returns, also costs (there are none in this simple example)
```

[Here](notebooks/introduction_with_fxdata.ipynb) you can find a modified version of this example using IB data instead of pre-baked CSV data files.

## A simple system

(code is [here](/examples/introduction/simplesystem.py) )

This is all very well, but what we probably want to do is build a trading **system** composed of several trading rules, and a few more instruments.

A system consists of some `data` (which we've already seen), a number of processing *stages*, and optionally a configuration to modify how each of the stages behaves.

A full list of stages would include:

1. Preprocessing some raw data (which we don't cover in this introduction)
2. Running some trading rules over it to generate forecasts
3. Scaling and capping those forecasts
4. Combining forecasts together
5. Position sizing
6. Creating a portfolio of instruments
7. Working out the p&l

For now let's start with the simplest possible system, one which contains only a trading rules stage. Let's just setup our environment again:

```python
from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData
data=csvFuturesSimData()

from systems.provided.rules.ewmac import ewmac_forecast_with_defaults as ewmac
```

This is a slightly different version of the rule we defined before, which has default values for `Lfast` and `Lslow`. Now there are many ways to create a set of trading rules; here is the simplest:

```python
from systems.forecasting import Rules
my_rules=Rules(ewmac)
my_rules.trading_rules()
```

```
{'rule0': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac_forecast_with_defaults at 0xb727fa4c>, data:  and other_args: }
```

This won't make much sense now, but bear with me (and don't worry if you get a different hexadecimal number). Suffice to say we've created a dict of trading rules with one variation, which has been given the thrilling name of `rule0`. `rule0` isn't especially meaningful, so let's come up with a better name:

```python
my_rules=Rules(dict(ewmac=ewmac))
my_rules.trading_rules()
```

```
{'ewmac': TradingRule; function: <function ewmac_forecast_with_defaults at 0xb72bca4c>, data:  and other_args: }
```

The next stage is to create a system incorporating our `data` object, and the `my_rules` stage.

```python
from systems.basesystem import System
my_system=System([my_rules], data)
my_system
```

```
System with stages: rules
```

We can now get forecasts:

```python
my_system.rules.get_raw_forecast("SOFR", "ewmac").tail(5)
```

```
2016-05-05    4.602536
2016-05-06    4.649790
2016-05-09    4.726840
2016-05-10    4.896521
2016-05-11    5.083896
Freq: B, dtype: float64
```

This is exactly what we got in the simple example above; but with far more work. Don't worry, it will be worth it.

We'll see this pattern of `my_system...stage name...get_something()` a lot. The `Rules` object has become an attribute of the parent system, with name `rules`. Notice that the names used for each stage are fixed regardless of exactly what the stage class or instance is called, so we can always find what we need.

What about if we want more than one trading rule, say a couple of variations of the ewmac rule? To define two different flavours of ewmac we're going to need to learn a little bit more about trading rules. Remember when we had `my_rules=Rules(dict(ewmac=ewmac))`? Well this is an equivalent way of doing it:

```python

from systems.trading_rules import TradingRule

ewmac_rule = TradingRule(ewmac)
my_rules = Rules(dict(ewmac=ewmac_rule))
ewmac_rule
```

```
TradingRule; function: <function ewmac_forecast_with_defaults at 0xb734ca4c>, data:  and other_args:
```

Time to reveal what the mysterious object is. A `TradingRule` contains 3 elements - a function, a list of any data the function needs, and a dict of any other arguments that can be passed to the function. So the function is just the `ewmac` function that we imported earlier, and in this trivial case there is no data, and no arguments. Having no data is fine, because the code assumes that you'd normally want to pass the price of an instrument to a trading rule if you don't tell it otherwise. Furthermore on this occasion having no arguments is also no problem since the ewmac function we're using includes some defaults.

*If you're familiar with the concept in python of args and kwargs; `data` is a bit like args - we always pass a list of positional arguments to `function`; and `other_args` are a bit like kwargs - we always pass in a dict of named arguments to `function`*

There are a few different ways to define trading rules completely. I'll use a couple of different ones here:

```python
ewmac_8=TradingRule((ewmac, [], dict(Lfast=8, Lslow=32))) ## as a tuple (function, data, other_args) notice the empty element in the middle
ewmac_32=TradingRule(dict(function=ewmac, other_args=dict(Lfast=32, Lslow=128)))  ## as a dict
my_rules=Rules(dict(ewmac8=ewmac_8, ewmac32=ewmac_32))
my_rules.trading_rules()['ewmac32']
```

```
TradingRule; function: <function ewmac_forecast_with_defaults at 0xb7252a4c>, data:  and other_args: Lfast, Lslow
```

Again, let's check that `ewmac32` is the same as the `ewmac` we have before (it should be, since 32, 128 are the default arguments for the underlying trading rule function).

```python
my_system=System([my_rules], data)
my_system.rules.get_raw_forecast("SOFR", "ewmac32").tail(5)
```

```

2016-05-10    4.896521
2016-05-11    5.083896
Freq: B, dtype: float64
```


Now let's introduce the idea of **config** objects. A `config` or configuration object allows us to control the behaviour of the various stages in the system.

Configuration objects can be created on the fly or by reading in files written in yaml (which we'll talk about below). A configuration object is just a collection of attributes. We create them interactively like so:

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
my_config=Config()
my_config
```

```
Config with elements:
## this line intentionally left blank. Apart from this comment of course.
```

So far, not exciting. Let's see how we'd use a `config` to define our trading rules:

```python
empty_rules=Rules()
my_config.trading_rules=dict(ewmac8=ewmac_8, ewmac32=ewmac_32)
my_system=System([empty_rules], data, my_config)
print(my_system.rules.get_raw_forecast("SOFR", "ewmac8"))
```

Notice the differences from before:

1. We pass in an 'empty' instance of rules that contains no arguments
2. We create an element in `config`: `trading_rules`, that contains our dictionary of trading rules
3. The system uses the `config.trading_rules`
4. We access the `empty_rules` object via the `System`. The attribute names of different kinds of objects are fixed, and aren't affected by what the instance or class is called (it will always be `rules`, not `Rules` or `empty_rules`)

*Note if you'd passed the dict of trading rules into Rules()* **and** *into the config, only the former would be used*

Why do we have this alternative method of specifying trading rules? Indeed why the option of using config at all. The answer it's that's a much more robust method for defining system behaviour than having pages of scripts defining how the system behaves. This is especially true in a production system. Why do we need an empty instance of Rules()? Well effectively we build our System object up from building blocks like Rules. These are usually just empty instances of a given class with no arguments passed, which are controlled by the contents of the configuration object also passed to system.
 
So in a sense passing Rules(dict(....)) is not the normal behaviour, it's just sometimes nice to be able to do this so I allow it.

Now these trading rules aren't producing forecasts that are correctly scaled (with an average absolute value of 10), and they don't have the cap of 20 that I recommend. To fix this we need to add another *stage* to our system: forecast scaling and capping.
Stages are added by including extra objects in the list which is the first argument passed to `System`. The order of these doesn't matter.

We could estimate these on a rolling out of sample basis:

```python
from systems.forecast_scale_cap import ForecastScaleCap


## By default we pool estimates across instruments. It's worth telling the system what instruments we want to use:
#
my_config.instruments=["SOFR", "US10", "CORN", "SP500_micro"]

## this parameter ensures we estimate:
my_config.use_forecast_scale_estimates=True

fcs=ForecastScaleCap()
my_system = System([fcs, my_rules], data, my_config)
print(my_system.forecastScaleCap.get_forecast_scalar("SOFR", "ewmac32").tail(5))
```

```

Freq: B, dtype: float64
```


Alternatively we can use the fixed values from Appendix B of my book ["Systematic Trading"](https://www.systematicmoney.org/systematic-trading).


```python
my_config.forecast_scalars=dict(ewmac8=5.3, ewmac32=2.65)

## this parameter ensures we don't estimate:
my_config.use_forecast_scale_estimates=False

my_system=System([fcs, empty_rules], data, my_config)

print(my_system.forecastScaleCap.get_forecast_scalar("SOFR", "ewmac32"))
2.65 # now a single float value

my_system.forecastScaleCap.get_capped_forecast("SOFR", "ewmac32")
```

*Note that the order of stages in the list passed to `System([...], ...)` isn't relevant*

*We didn't have to pass the forecast cap of 20.0, since the system was happy to use the default value (this is defined in the system defaults file, which the full [users guide](backtesting.md) will tell you more about).*

Since we have two trading rule variations we're naturally going to want to combine them (chapter 8 of my book). For a very quick and dirty exercise running this code will use equal forecast weights across instruments, and use no diversification multiplier:

```python
from systems.forecast_combine import ForecastCombine

combiner = ForecastCombine()
my_system = System([fcs, empty_rules, combiner], data, my_config)
my_system.combForecast.get_forecast_weights("SOFR").tail(5)
my_system.combForecast.get_forecast_diversification_multiplier("SOFR").tail(5)

```

```
WARNING: No forecast weights  - using equal weights of 0.5000 over all 2 trading rules in system

```

Alternatively you can estimate div. multipliers, and weights.

Note: Since we need to know the performance of different trading rules, we need to include an Accounts stage to calculate these which in turn uses position sizing and raw data:

```python
from systems.rawdata import RawData
from systems.positionsizing import PositionSizing
from systems.accounts.accounts_stage import Account
combiner = ForecastCombine()
raw_data = RawData()
position_size = PositionSizing()
my_account = Account()

## let's use naive markowitz to get more interesting results...
my_config.forecast_weight_estimate = dict(method="one_period")
my_config.use_forecast_weight_estimates = True
my_config.use_forecast_div_mult_estimates = True

combiner = ForecastCombine()
my_system = System([my_account, fcs, my_rules, combiner, position_size, raw_data], data, my_config)

print(my_system.combForecast.get_forecast_weights("US10").tail(5))
print(my_system.combForecast.get_forecast_diversification_multiplier("US10").tail(5))

```

```

A little extreme, I feel. Let's use some arbitrary fixed forecast weights and diversification multiplier for now:


```python
my_config.forecast_weights=dict(ewmac8=0.5, ewmac32=0.5)
my_config.forecast_div_multiplier=1.1
my_config.use_forecast_weight_estimates = False
my_config.use_forecast_div_mult_estimates = False
my_system=System([fcs, empty_rules, combiner, raw_data, position_size], data, my_config)
my_system.combForecast.get_combined_forecast("SOFR").tail(5)
```

```

If you're working through my book you'd know the next stage is deciding what level of risk to target (chapter 9) and position sizing (chapter 10).
Let's do the position scaling:

```python

my_config.percentage_vol_target=25
my_config.notional_trading_capital=500000
my_config.base_currency="GBP"

my_system=System([ fcs, empty_rules, combiner, position_size, raw_data], data, my_config)

my_system.positionSize.get_subsystem_position("SOFR").tail(5)
```




```

```

We're almost there. The final stage we need to get positions is to combine everything into a portfolio (chapter 11).

We can estimate these:

```python
from systems.portfolio import Portfolios
portfolio = Portfolios()

## Using shrinkage will speed things but - but I don't recommend it for actual trading...
my_config.use_instrument_weight_estimates = True
my_config.use_instrument_div_mult_estimates = True
my_config.instrument_weight_estimate=dict(method="shrinkage", date_method="in_sample") ## speeds things up

my_system = System([my_account, fcs, my_rules, combiner, position_size, raw_data,
                    portfolio], data, my_config)

print(my_system.portfolio.get_instrument_weights())
print(my_system.portfolio.get_instrument_diversification_multiplier())
```

Alternatively we can just make up some instrument weights, and diversification multiplier.

*Again if we really couldn't be bothered, this would default to equal weights and 1.0 respectively*

```python
my_config.instrument_weights=dict(US10=.1, SOFR=.4, CORN=.3, SP500_micro=.8)
my_config.instrument_div_multiplier=1.5
my_config.use_instrument_weight_estimates = False
my_config.use_instrument_div_mult_estimates = False

Although this is fine and dandy, we're probably going to be curious about whether this made money or not. So we'll need to add just one more stage, to count our virtual profits:

```python
from systems.accounts.accounts_stage import Account
accounts=Account()
my_system=System([ fcs, empty_rules, combiner, position_size, raw_data, portfolio, accounts], data, my_config)
profits=my_system.accounts.portfolio()
profits.percent.stats()
```

```
[[('min', '-0.1349'), ('max', '0.1313'), ('median', '-4.308e-06'), ('mean', '0.0005715'), ('std', '0.01726'), ('skew', '-0.1568'), ('ann_mean', '0.1463'), ('ann_std', '0.2762'), ('sharpe', '0.5297'), ...)]

```

Once again we have the now familiar accounting object. Some results have been removed, in the interests of staying awake.

These are profits net of tax. You can see the gross profits and costs:

```python
profits.gross.percent.stats() ## all other things work eg profits.gross.sharpe()
profits.costs.percent.stats()
```

For more see the costs and accountCurve section of the user guide.


## Getting config from dictionaries and files

To speed things up you can also pass a dictionary to `Config()`. To reproduce the setup we had above we'd make a dict like so:

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
my_config=Config(dict(trading_rules=dict(ewmac8=ewmac_8, ewmac32=ewmac_32), instrument_weights=dict(US10=.1, SOFR=.4, CORN=.3, SP500_micro=.2), instrument_div_multiplier=1.5, forecast_scalars=dict(ewmac8=5.3, ewmac32=2.65), forecast_weights=dict(ewmac8=0.5, ewmac32=0.5), forecast_div_multiplier=1.1
,percentage_vol_target=25, notional_trading_capital=500000, base_currency="GBP"))
my_config
```

Note we don't need to tell the config that we're not using estimation for forecast scalars, forecast weights and instrument weights; this is the default behaviour.

```
Config with elements: base_currency, forecast_div_multiplier, forecast_scalars, forecast_weights, instrument_div_multiplier, instrument_weights, notional_trading_capital, percentage_vol_target, trading_rules
```

Alternatively we could get the same result from reading a [yaml](https://pyyaml.org) file ( [this one to be precise](/systems/provided/example/simplesystemconfig.yaml) ). Don't worry if you're not familiar with yaml; it's just a nice way of creating nested dicts, lists and other python objects in plain text. Just be aware that indentations are important, just in like python.

```python
my_config=Config("systems.provided.example.simplesystemconfig.yaml")
```

(Notice we don't put filenames in; rather a python style reference within the project)

If you look at the YAML file you'll notice that the trading rule function has been specified as a string `systems.provided.rules.ewmac.ewmac_forecast_with_defaults`. This is because we can't easily create a function in a YAML text file (*we can in theory; but it's quite a bit of work and creates a potential security risk*). Instead we specify where the relevant function can be found in the project directory structure.

Similarly for the ewmac8 rule we've specified a data source `data.daily_prices` which points to `system.data.daily_prices()`. This is the default, which is why we haven't needed to specify it before, and it isn't included in the specification for the ewmac32 rule. Equally we could specify any attribute and method within the system object, as long as it takes the argument `instrument_code`. We can also have a list of data inputs. This means you can configure almost any trading rule quite easily through configuration changes.



## A simple pre-baked system

Normally we wouldn't create a system by adding each stage manually (importing and creating long lists of stage objects). Instead you can use a 'pre baked' system, and then modify it as required.

For example here is a pre-baked version of the previous example (code is [here](/examples/introduction/prebakedsystems.py) ):

```python
from systems.provided.example.simplesystem import simplesystem
my_system=simplesystem()
my_system
```

```
System with stages: accounts, portfolio, positionSize, combForecast, forecastScaleCap, rules
```

Everything will now work as before:

```python
my_system.portfolio.get_notional_position("SOFR").tail(5)
```



By default this has loaded the same data and read the config from the same yaml file. However we can also do this manually, allowing us to use new `data` and a modified `config` with a pre-baked system.

```python
from sysdata.config.configdata import Config
from sysdata.sim.csv_futures_sim_data import csvFuturesSimData

my_config=Config("systems.provided.example.simplesystemconfig.yaml")
my_data=csvFuturesSimData()

## I could change my_config, and my_data here if I wanted to
my_system=simplesystem(config=my_config, data=my_data)
```

For the vast majority of the time this will be how you create new systems.


## A complete pre-baked system

Let's now see how we might use another 'pre-baked' system, in this case the staunch systems trader example defined in chapter 15 of my book. Here again we default to using csv data.

(Code is [here](/examples/introduction/prebakedsystems.py) )

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.basesystem import futures_system
system=futures_system()
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EUROSTX").tail(5)
```

```
                 pos
2015-12-04  0.624183
2015-12-07  0.629924
2015-12-08  0.538517
2015-12-09  0.451322
2015-12-10  0.385892

```

It's worth looking at the config for this system [here](/systems/provided/futures_chapter15/futuresconfig.yaml), and comparing it to what you see in chapter 15.

You can also get a similar system where forecast scalars are estimated; as well as forecast / instrument diversification multipliers and weights. Because estimation takes a while, it's worth turning logging on full to keep track of what's going on.

```python
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.estimatedsystem import futures_system
system = futures_system()
system.portfolio.get_notional_position("EUROSTX").tail(5)
```

Because this runs quite slowly you might want to save the system data. This lives in the cache attribute.

```python
system.cache.pickle("private.this_system_name.pck") ## use any file extension you like

## In a new session
from systems.provided.futures_chapter15.estimatedsystem import futures_system
system = futures_system()
system.cache.unpickle("private.this_system_name.pck")
system.accounts.portfolio().sharpe() ## this will run much faster and reuse previous calculations
```

You'll probably want to read the [backtesting guide](backtesting.md) next.
