"""
This piece of code processes the interface between the instrument order stack and the contract order stack and the broker order stack

Tasks it needs to accomplish:

- netting of parent orders FIX ME FUTURE
- when a new order is added to the instrument stack with no child orders, create child orders in contract order stack
- when roll status is 'force', and no parent orders, generate an 'orphan roll order (spread or outright)
- when a roll order is happening, need to lock instrument and related instruments
- when a parent order is moved to modification status, change child orders to modification status
- when all child orders are in modification complete status, change parent order to modification complete
- when a parent order and child orders are all in modification complete status, clear modification from parents and children
- when a child order has an updated fill, give the parent order a fill
  - if multiple child orders, give the parent order the fill min(child order fills)
